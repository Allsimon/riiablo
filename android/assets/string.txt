Greetings, stranger. I'm not surprised 
to see your kind here. Many 
adventurers have traveled this way 
since the recent troubles began.
 
No doubt you've heard about the 
tragedy that befell the town of 
Tristram. Some say that Diablo, the 
Lord of Terror, walks the world again.
 
I don't know if I believe that, but a Dark 
Wanderer did travel this route a few 
weeks ago. He was headed east to the 
mountain pass guarded by the Rogue 
Monastery.
 
Maybe it's nothing, but evil seems to 
have trailed in his wake. You see, 
shortly after the Wanderer went 
through, the Monastery's Gates to the 
pass were closed and strange 
creatures began ravaging the 
countryside.
 
Until it's safer outside the camp and the 
gates are re-opened, I'll remain here 
with my caravan. I hope to leave for 
Lut Gholein before the shadow that fell 
over Tristram consumes us all.  If 
you're still alive then, I'll take you 
along.
 
You should talk to Akara, too. She 
seems to be the leader of this camp. 
Maybe she can tell you more.

Well met, noble Paladin. It's been a 
while since I've seen any of your kind in 
the west. It would be an honor to aid 
you in any way that I can.
 
No doubt you've heard about the 
tragedy that befell the town of 
Tristram. Some say that Diablo, the 
Lord of Terror, walks the world again.
 
I don't know if I believe that, but a Dark

I've been leading my trade caravan 
across the eastern deserts for more 
than twenty years now. I've been 
attacked by bandits and outlaws more 
times than I can remember. But never 
when a Paladin accompanied me. 
 
Indeed, your Order has saved me from 
losing a small fortune over the years. I 
just hope you can discover what's 
going on around here and get the 
Gates to the East opened up!
 
    3 85
Cain seems to have great wisdom 
regarding the supernatural. I hope I 
never live to be that wise...
 
    4 58
Akara is the Rogues' High Priestess. She 
sells the few magic items in her 
possession and can even heal your 
wounds. She is very wise and will help 
you if she can.
 
    5 66
The fiery Kashya commands the Rogue 
archers in battle. I've only spoken to 
her a few times, though. I get the 
feeling that she doesn't like outsiders 
very much.
 
    6 88
Charsi seems to be a very sweet girl. 
She's the smith around here and can 
help you by trading weapons and 
armor.
 
    7 55
Gheed is a wandering merchant of 
questionable character who is traveling 
along with my caravan to the East. He 
will buy and sell most anything.
 
He's greedy, but his wares are beyond 
reproach. I would suggest keeping both 
eyes open when you deal with him.
 
    8 71
To the east are lands of great 
mystery... and the Jewel City of the 
Desert, Lut Gholein.
 
    9 68
I'll gladly take you eastward, if you can 
drive the Evil from the Monastery.  
Then, the Rogues may re-open the pass 
through the mountains.
 
   10 70
It's easy to become lost in the 
wilderness on the way to the Citadel. 
After you have come to the Cairn 
Stones, you must remember that the 
path continues through the caves.
 
   11 35
I am Akara, High Priestess of the 
Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye. I 
welcome you, traveler, to our camp, 
but I'm afraid I can offer you but poor 
shelter within these rickety walls.
 
You see, our ancient Sisterhood has 
fallen under a strange curse. The 
mighty Citadel from which we have 
guarded the gates to the East for 
generations, has been corrupted by the 
evil Demoness, Andariel.
 
I still can't believe it... but she turned 
many of our sister Rogues against us 
and drove us from our ancestral home. 
Now the last defenders of the 
Sisterhood are either dead or scattered 
throughout the wilderness.
 
I implore you, stranger. Please help us. 
Find a way to lift this terrible curse and 
we will pledge our loyalty to you for all 
time.
 
   12 34
Greetings, young Sorceress. It is good 
to see more of your kind at work in the 
world these dark days. In my opinion, 
the world needs more women to fight 
against the great shadow. But I am 
forgetting my manners... 
 
I am Akara, High Priestess of the 
Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye. I 
welcome you, traveler, to our camp, 
but I'm afraid I can offer you but poor 
shelter within these rickety walls.
 
You see, our ancient Sisterhood has 
fallen under a strange curse. The 
mighty Citadel from which we have 
guarded the gates to the East for 
generations, has been corrupted by the 
evil Demoness, Andariel.
 
I still can't believe it... but she turned 
many of our sister Rogues against us 
and drove us from our ancestral home. 
Now the last defenders of the 
Sisterhood are either dead or scattered 
throughout the wilderness.
 
I implore you, stranger: please help us. 
Find a way to lift this terrible curse and 
we will pledge our loyalty to you for all 
time.
 
   13 42
The Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye has 
a long and distinguished history. Over 
the generations our Order has become 
a deadly fighting force as well as a 
bastion for women who sought to forge 
their own destiny.
 
Yet beware, young one, the lure of 
power and knowledge can lead to 
disaster. I have seen ambition foul the 
bravest of hearts and recklessness dull 
hard-won wisdom.
 
You would do well to tread lightly upon 
the dark path you have chosen to 
explore.
 
   14 49
I understand that Cain is the last 
descendant of the ancient Horadrim 
and that his knowledge of their lore is 
vast. He could prove to be very useful 
in discerning the nature of our current 
crisis.
 
   15 49
Kashya has always been fiercely loyal, 
but I fear her anger and frustration 
over these recent events will lead her 
into harm's way. She is highly 
protective of the few Rogues remaining 
under her command and will not send 
them into combat unless there is dire 
need.
 
   16 46
Charsi is young and innocent. However, 
I believe her Barbarian blood thrills to 
the prospect of adventure and danger. 
She takes great pride in her work and 
finds comfort in the fact that her 
weapons and armor are helping to end 
this evil plague.
 
   17 48
Though he has only been our guest for 
a short time, I sense that Warriv has 
faced many harrowing trials. Though 
he knows, as I do, that a terrible evil 
has blanketed the land, his only real 
concern is to reach the eastern trading 
ports with his caravan.
 
   18 53
To be honest, I have done my best to 
stay clear of Gheed. He wears 
dishonesty about himself like a cloak 
and seeks only to better his situation 
by preying on the misfortunes of 
others.
 
   19 55
The wilderness is overrun with Evil and 
the minions of Hell have taken our 
rightful home. We must purge all Evil 
from the Monastery and restore order 
to the world.
 
   20 53
I often dream of the day we reclaim our 
own. The Sightless Eye sees through 
the mist of time a great glory ahead, 
but how far ahead the Eye cannot 
discern.
 
   21 67
Our mental discipline is matched only by 
our skill in archery... I only hope these 
are enough to withstand this awful 
trial.
 
   22 59
Beware that you do not suffer the fate 
of the corrupted Rogues. To lose one's 
life is a tragedy, but to lose one's soul 
is even worse.
 
   23 41
Even though the corrupted ones were 
once of our Order, you need not shy 
from slaying them, for they stand 
between you and Andariel.
 
Perhaps, when the Demon Queen is 
dead, our Sisters will return to life, but 
more likely they will be forever bound 
to their unholy pact.
 
   24 56
Welcome, outlander, to our glorious 
hovel. I know you're here to challenge 
the evil that's driven us from our 
ancestral home.
 
But, know this. Akara may be our 
spiritual leader, but I command the 
Rogues in battle. It will take more than 
just killing a few beasts in the 
wilderness to earn my trust.
 
   25 55
Well, well, I never expected to see an 
Amazon in these lands. You're very 
brave to have come here. Many of my 
fellow Sisters have fallen under some 
dark spell, and if you're not careful you 
may fall prey to it as well.
 
   26 60
When I was very young, Akara told me 
tales of the Amazons' fearlessness in 
battle and of their skills with spears 
and bows. I like to think we Rogues 
have much in common with you 
Amazons.
 
   27 64
Some of my Rogues told me of Deckard 
Cain. They said that he is a man of 
great wisdom. Personally, I don't know 
how wise he could possibly be if he 
never learned how to wage battle 
himself.
 
   28 57
Akara has been like a mother to me for 
as long as I can remember. She is wise 
and good, but I don't think she has the 
steel to retake our Monastery by force.
 
   29 89
I don't trust many outlanders, but 
Warriv seems fine. He never says much 
to me, though.
 
   30 66
Before our exile, Charsi, our blacksmith, 
could fashion any implement of war.
 
Here in the camp, she merely makes do. 
Her best tools remain within the 
Monastery.
 
   31 58
Gheed is a pig. I've been tempted to 
throw him out of the camp many times, 
but Charsi seems to think that he's 
good company. I don't trust the man, 
but if she's comforted by him, then I'll 
desist.
 
   32 76
If we could only find out how Andariel 
has managed to corrupt our Sisters, 
then, perhaps, we could drive out the 
evil clouding their minds.
 
   33 68
In this camp, those of us who have 
remained true to our Order are forced 
to live among common traders and 
farm animals.
 
Welcome to our circle of suffering.
 
   34 67
Perhaps Tristram deserved its fate... 
for letting Evil loose upon the land. I 
only hope we don't suffer the same.
 
   35 71
Some evenings we gather at the bonfire 
to retell epic tales... and try to forget 
about the terrible events that led to 
losing the Monastery.
 
   36 47
Hi there. I'm Charsi, the blacksmith here 
in camp. It's good to see some strong 
adventurers around here.
 
Many of our Sisters fought bravely 
against Diablo when he first attacked 
the town of Tristram. They came back 
to us true veterans, bearing some 
really powerful items. Seems like their 
victory was short-lived, though... Most 
of them are now corrupted by Andariel.
 
   37 54
Wow. You're a Barbarian, huh? It's 
really great to meet you. I've seen a 
few of your kind around here lately. I'm 
a little jealous... I wish I could go off 
adventuring with you.
 
Oh, by the way... I'm Charsi, the 
blacksmith here in camp.
 
   38 57
You know, I've been with the Sisters for 
as long as I can remember. But Akara 
told me that my real parents were 
Barbarians from the northern tribes 
and that they were killed when I was 
very young.
 
Sometimes I wonder what my life would 
have been like if I had been raised as a 
Barbarian.
 
I don't know. I love being a blacksmith... 
but sometimes I just want to get out 
and explore the world, you know?
 
   39 86
I don't really know anything about Cain. 
He seems to have a lot of secrets... 
That makes me nervous.
 
   40 51
Oh, Kashya's fantastic. Sure, she's a 
little hard on outsiders, but who can 
blame her? All she wants is to protect 
our Order. But now that our Sisters 
have turned against us... I think this 
whole mess has hardened her heart.
 
   41 64
Akara, our priestess and seer, is most 
upset by the corruption of our Sisters. 
I fear that she blames herself.
 
   42 80
Warriv's all right, I guess. He seems too 
serious most of the time. I haven't 
really talked to him all that much.
 
   43 60
Oh, I like Gheed. He's very funny. He 
has all sorts of interesting stories from 
the places he's been. I wish I could see 
the sights he has.
 
   44 84
I don't know why some of my Sisters 
chose to follow Andariel. Those who 
strayed were among our finest 
warriors.
 
   45 48
Good day to you partner! I'm Gheed and 
I can already tell that I'll be your best 
friend in this forsaken camp.
 
A spare weapon, some gold, a small 
gem is all I want in exchange for the 
equipment you'll need on whatever 
quests you might undertake.
 
Now, now, now... Don't be shy, all of my 
items are guaranteed for life and come 
with a two-day warranty!
 
   46 46
A Necromancer! I hoped I'd never have 
to lay my eyes on one of your kind 
again. ... The recent troubles in this 
area have brought out all kinds, I see. 
Nevertheless, your money's good...
 
A spare weapon, some gold, a small 
gem is all I want in exchange for the 
equipment you'll need on whatever 
quests you might undertake!
 
Now, now, now... Don't be shy, all of my 
items are guaranteed for life and come 
with a two-day warranty!
 
   47 74
Don't think you can fool me, 
Necromancer. I've seen what your kind 
can do. If you're involved in any of the 
evil out there, I don't even want to 
know. Trade quickly and be about your 
business!
 
   48 57
That old coot, Cain, is as crazy as a wet 
Quill Rat. I hear he survived whatever 
happened in Tristram. Personally, I 
wouldn't trust a thing he has to say.
 
   49 55
Akara and Kashya are Sisters in the 
Order of the Sightless Eye, but they are 
worlds apart. Akara is a slow river of 
magic, and Kashya, a viper of war. 
They're both deeply devoted to their 
religious order, yet the corruption of 
their Sisters pains them both to no 
end.
 
   50 52
Charsi is a fine girl..., but she has no 
business savvy! I know she means well, 
but the prices she charges for weapons 
and armor will never earn her a profit.
 
As long as I keep filling her mind with 
stories of adventure, she'll never catch 
on to the fact that I'm raking in gold 
hand over fist!
 
   51 55
Warriv was kind enough to let me travel 
with his caravan, but don't let him drag 
you into a search for a new Eastern 
trade route.
 
I'm making a fortune right here... from 
the Rogues, of course! You, on the 
other hand, always get my best prices!
 
   52 61
Andariel's demonic forces have taken up 
residence in the forests as well as the 
Monastery. Uh-uh. I won't be venturing 
out of the camp. So, if you need 
anything, I'll be right here.
 
   53 58
When - or if - I get to Lut Gholein, I'm 
going to find the largest bowl of 
Narlant weed and smoke 'til all earthly 
sense has left my body.
 
   54 43
Long ago, the Soulstones were given to 
the Horadrim by the Archangel Tyrael. 
They were used to bind the three Prime 
Evils. I now know that even these holy 
artifacts were no match for Diablo's 
power.
 
I hope that his two brothers are more 
securely held... but I fear the worst.
 
   55 54
It takes time to master your skills... and 
use will hone your technique. But take 
care to choose your new skills wisely.
 
   56 52
You may recover some mysterious 
things from the demons you kill. Some 
of great use to you... some of great 
peril! Bring them to me and I'll reveal 
their secrets.
 
   57 46
Have I told you about the Horadrim? 
They were an ancient confederation of 
mage-clans who sought to bind the 
three Prime Evils for eternity. The 
Horadrim are now nearly forgotten... 
and it appears that the bonds they 
wove are unravelling!
 
As the last of the Horadrim, I pray that 
I can help you remedy their failure.
 
   58 43
Long ago, Diablo and his brothers were 
cast out of Hell by the Lesser Evils. It 
seems that Hell's balance has shifted, 
as Andariel is now aligned with the 
Lord of Terror. Her presence here in 
the mortal realm does not bode well for 
us.
 
   59 90
Turn back! I can tell that you need more 
experience to fight safely in the next 
wilderness.
 
   60 46
Halt! You should complete Akara's quest 
before venturing further. Search for 
the Den in the wilderness closer to 
camp.
 
   61 116
Beware! The evil is strong ahead.
 
   62 92
Beware! Beyond lies mortal danger for 
the likes of you!
 
   63 88
Take care! The Corrupted Rogues in the 
wilderness ahead are not to be trifled 
with.
 
   64 43
There is a place of great evil in the 
wilderness. Kashya's Rogue scouts 
have informed me that a cave nearby is 
filled with shadowy creatures and 
horrors from beyond the grave.
 
I fear that these creatures are massing 
for an attack against our encampment. 
If you are sincere about helping us, 
find the dark labyrinth and destroy the 
foul beasts.
 
May the Great Eye watch over you.
 
   65 46
I should add that many Rogue scouts 
have died in that horrible place. We 
cannot afford to lose any more. If you 
choose to enter that Den of Evil, you 
must do so alone.
 
   66 87
The demons in that cave have claimed 
many of my finest archers. I wonder 
how you will fare!
 
   67 95
The beasts from the cave have begun to 
roam throughout the countryside. 
You'd better be careful out there.
 
   68 95
You seem like a noble warrior. I hope 
you can help us.
 
   69 67
You're a brave soul! I'd sooner thrust 
my sacred scepter into the foulest, 
carbuncular trull than set one boot 
into that cave.
 
   70 122
One who seeks that cave, seeks death.
 
   71 85
Your task is not complete until you have 
killed all the demons in that cave.
 
   72 111
You'd better come through on this. Your 
reputation depends on it.
 
   73 148
You haven't cleared the cave, yet? Do 
you need anything?
 
   74 73
Demons still befouling that cave, huh? I 
think you might need a new weapon.
 
   75 124
One who hesitates... does so with good 
reason.
 
   76 65
You have cleansed the Den of Evil. 
You've earned my trust and may yet 
restore my faith in humanity.
 
Your reward is training in the skill of 
your choice.
 
   77 74
Hmm. I'm surprised you survived that 
test, outlander. Go see Akara. She may 
reward you.
 
   78 94
You are truly brave and skillful...  Akara 
was worried about you.
 
   79 87
The only good demon is a dead one, I 
say.
 
By the way, did you happen to find 
anything in that cave you'd like to sell?
 
   80 120
...That which does not kill you makes 
you stronger.
 
   81 56
My Rogue scouts have just reported an 
abomination in the Monastery 
graveyard!
 
Apparently, Andariel is not content to 
take only our living. Blood Raven, one 
of our finest captains in the battle 
against Diablo at Tristram, was also 
one of the first to be corrupted by 
Andariel.
 
Now, you'll find her in the Monastery 
graveyard raising our dead as 
zombies!
 
We cannot abide this defilement! If you 
are truly our ally, you will help us 
destroy her.
 
   82 80
Death has done nothing to weaken 
Blood Raven's combat skills. If 
anything, she's more deadly than ever.
 
   83 99
Blood Raven was the leader of a Rogue 
band that once fought Diablo at 
Tristram.
 
   84 94
I'm sorry... The undead are bad for 
trade. I have a strict no-return policy.
 
   85 51
Blood Raven fought valiantly against 
Diablo in the catacombs beneath 
Tristram... She was never quite the 
same afterwards. It is now obvious she 
brought an evil influence back with her.
 
   86 140
Hmmm...
 
How can one kill what is already dead?
 
   87 99
Each moment you delay adds another 
undead Sister to Blood Raven's army.
 
   88 70
If you fail to destroy Blood Raven, I fear 
that our Order will perish forever.
 
   89 68
Akara felt something was wrong even 
before Andariel descended upon us. 
She feared that Blood Raven had 
stumbled upon some evil force beneath 
Tristram.
 
I wish we had acted then...
 
   90 77
I wonder if that old gossip, Melra, is 
among the undead? Oh, she had dirt on 
everybody.
 
   91 86
When the dead return to prey upon the 
living, it is a terror beyond 
understanding.
 
   92 55
I can hardly believe that you've defeated 
Blood Raven!
 
Though she was once my closest friend, 
I pray that her tortured spirit remains 
banished forever.
 
You have earned my respect, stranger... 
and the allegiance of the Rogues. I 
have placed several of my best 
warriors at your disposal.
 
   93 122
Andariel must be made to pay for her 
sacrilege!
 
   94 77
Kashya wishes to reward you for your 
defeat of Blood Raven. I thank you, 
too, even though Blood Raven was once 
my friend.
 
   95 148
Some of those gals weren't so nice the 
first time around.
 
   96 104
You've done well, stranger. I hope all 
your efforts are worth it.
 
   97 50
It is clear that we are facing an Evil 
difficult to comprehend, let alone 
combat.
 
There is only one Horadrim sage, 
schooled in the most arcane history 
and lore, who could advise us... His 
name is Deckard Cain.
 
You must go to Tristram and find him, 
my friend. I pray that he still lives.
 
   98 90
The bark of Inifuss holds mystical 
runes.
 
Akara can translate them... into our 
revenge!
 
   99 42
Tristram is too far to journey by foot...  
Cain would likely be dead, when you 
arrived. However, there is a magical 
portal that will take you there 
instantly.
 
To open it, one must stand within the 
circle of Cairn Stones and touch them 
in a certain order. The proper order 
can be found in the runes written on 
the bark of the Tree of Inifuss.
 
You must find the sacred Tree of Inifuss 
and bring back its bark. I will translate 
the runes to unlock the Stones' mystic 
pattern.
 
  100 117
If you bring back the bark of Inifuss, 
Akara will tell you how to get to 
Tristram.
 
  101 68
Months ago, I came across a few 
survivors from Tristram. They said 
that Cain had gone half-mad and could 
no longer distinguish fact from 
fantasy.
 
  102 98
I would sooner micturate in a tankard 
of my own ale than journey to 
Tristram!
 
  103 150
Without the bark of Inifuss you can't 
find Cain.
 
  104 76
How will you find Cain without going to 
Tristram? Finding the Tree of Inifuss is 
the first step on your journey.
 
  105 96
The Tree of Inifuss is hard to find, but 
you'll know it when you see it.
 
  106 99
Barking up the wrong tree, huh? You'll 
find it, just keep looking.
 
  107 70
He who seeks that which cannot be 
found must look inside himself for 
further guidance... or look harder!
 
  108 82
With this scroll you may open a portal 
back to Tristram. Only Akara can 
decipher its logic.
 
  109 168
Get this to Akara.
 
Only she can understand it.
 
  110 72
Look, friend... I trade a lot of strange 
items, but I'm not going to start 
dealing in bark. Okay?
 
  111 86
This looks like gibberish to me. Akara 
may know what to make of it.
 
  112 64
Ah, very good. I have translated the 
runes on this scroll. You must find the 
Cairn Stones and touch them in the 
order that I have written.
 
  113 103
Deckard Cain has crucial knowledge 
about the Evils we face. You must find 
him!
 
  114 92
I have heard that Tristram is now in 
ruins! Without Cain I fear for the ruin 
of all of us.
 
  115 68
I'm told that Tristram now resembles a 
mead hall... after a Barbarian wedding! 
I will wait here for your most glorious 
return.
 
  116 82
It is too dangerous to travel to 
Tristram. I won't be leaving here until 
the way is clear!
 
  117 64
If he still lives, Deckard Cain may be in 
grave peril! You must hurry to Tristram 
before all is lost!
 
  118 82
You have risked your life to rescue 
Cain. For that we thank you.
 
We must seek his counsel immediately.
 
  119 78
Again, you amaze me, outlander.
 
The Sisterhood is grateful to you for 
delivering Cain to us. I believe Akara 
has something to tell you.
 
  120 53
Ah, Cain is here... another customer. I 
haven't been this pleased since a 
love-starved maiden let down a bit 
more than her hair.
 
  121 102
Akara wishes to reward you for your 
bravery in returning Deckard Cain.
 
  122 80
Only a brave adventurer could return 
with Deckard Cain. Akara has a reward 
for your valor.
 
  123 74
As a token of my gratitude, I will 
identify items for you at no charge.
 
  124 82
...I thank you, friend, for coming to my 
aid.
 
  125 75
Oh... Blessings on the Rogues! They 
finally rescued me from that cursed 
place!
 
  126 33
Regrettably, I could do nothing to 
prevent the disaster which devastated 
Tristram. It would appear that our 
greatest fears have come to pass. 
Diablo, the Lord of Terror, has once 
again been set loose upon the world!
 
As you know, some time ago Diablo was 
slain beneath Tristram.  And when our 
hero emerged triumphant from the 
labyrinth beneath town, we held a 
grand celebration that lasted several 
days.
 
Yet, as the weeks passed, our hero 
became increasingly aloof. He kept his 
distance from the rest of the townsfolk 
and seemed to lapse into a dark, 
brooding depression. I thought that 
perhaps his ordeal had been so 
disturbing that he simply could not put 
it out of his mind.
 
The hero seemed more tormented every 
passing day. I remember he awoke 
many times -- screaming in the night -- 
always something about 'the East'.
 
One day, he simply left. And shortly 
thereafter Tristram was attacked by 
legions of foul demons. Many were 
slain, and the demons left me to die in 
that cursed cage.
 
I believe now that Tristram's hero was 
that Dark Wanderer who passed this 
way before the Monastery fell.
 
I fear even worse, my friend... I fear 
that Diablo has taken possession of the 
hero who sought to slay him. If true, 
Diablo will become more powerful than 
ever before.
 
You must stop him or all will be lost.
 
  127 36
...And so it came to pass that the 
Countess, who once bathed in the 
rejuvenating blood of a hundred 
virgins, was buried alive... And her 
castle in which so many cruel deeds 
took place fell rapidly into ruin. Rising 
over the buried dungeons in that 
god-forsaken wilderness, a solitary 
tower, like some monument to Evil, is 
all that remains.
 
The Countess' fortune was believed to 
be divided among the clergy, although 
some say that more remains unfound, 
still buried alongside the rotting skulls 
that bear mute witness to the 
inhumanity of the human creature.
 
  128 110
The only wealth you're likely to find 
there is a wealth of vermin.
 
  129 70
That old tower is as rotten on the inside 
as it appears on the outside. I heard 
that several Sisters came to a 
gruesome end when a stairwell 
collapsed on them.
 
  130 67
The dangers there are not solely 
architectural. Once inside that 
wretched place, many succumb to a 
vile miasma.
 
  131 60
That tower marks a place of danger. 
There is an epic poem about it...  How 
much sorrow one can stand was tested 
there.
 
  132 81
Rumors of treasure are no different 
from rumors of any other kind. They 
hold false promise to those who should 
know better.
 
  133 78
The tome speaks of treasure. Yet, all we 
have found are death, delirium, and 
disappointment.
 
  134 151
Have you suddenly lost your taste for 
wealth?
 
  135 94
Quickly in and quickly out is all the 
advice I can give you.
 
  136 118
Better an empty pocket than a full 
grave.
 
  137 170
You're not ready to give up, are you?
 
  138 140
There is no more I can tell you about 
that ancient tower.
 
  139 79
Guess what! I've named a boil on my 
ass after you. It, too, bothers me every 
time I sit down.
 
  140 79
Your rewards are well-earned. To us, 
the tower was nothing more than a 
headstone looming over a long 
forgotten grave.
 
  141 62
Remember. Wealth is as insubstantial 
as a cloud and passes as quickly. 
Ignore Gheed. All that twitters is not 
bold.
 
  142 68
Warriv's advice is like corpse gas; it 
befouls the air for a moment and then 
it disappears.
 
  143 58
I thought the stories of treasure in the 
tower were nothing but lies. I am glad 
you found something of value in that 
death-trap. Would that our Sisters had 
been so fortunate.
 
  144 126
Those riches will serve you well on the 
long road ahead.
 
  145 69
Well done, my friend. Courage and 
opportunity together have created in 
you a kind of alchemy.
 
  146 66
When I fled the Monastery, I left behind 
the Horadric Malus, my enchanted 
smithing hammer. If you can retrieve it 
for me, I'll use its magic to strengthen 
your equipment.
 
  147 51
The Malus was forged and enchanted by 
the ancient Horadric Mages during the 
Sin Wars. When their union dissolved, 
the Malus was entrusted to the 
Sisterhood guarding the pass into the 
East.
 
  148 59
The retrieval of the Horadric Malus is 
not without risk. Our Monastery is 
filled with voracious hellspawn. You'd 
best be careful, my friend.
 
  149 61
Charsi is wasting her time and talents 
using an inferior hammer! Had she the 
Horadric Malus, she could make the 
steel sing and craft you a suit of armor 
as impenetrable as the Great Eye.
 
  150 87
The Monastery can confuse even those 
who know it well. Stay alert in there.
 
  151 74
Charsi talks of nothing anymore, but 
this Horadric Malus. Between you and 
her my ears need a rest.
 
Just find it and bring it back quickly.
 
  152 74
I have offered my nomadic phallus, but 
to no avail.
 
  153 68
Just as an archer needs bow and arrow, 
or a draughtsman pen and paper, so 
Charsi needs the Horadric Malus with 
which to ply her trade.
 
  154 57
The Malus has eluded you so far. Well, 
search thoroughly in the Barracks... 
That is where the Rogues kept their 
forge.
 
  155 98
If you can't carry out this quest, how 
will you face the greater evils ahead?
 
  156 71
To do battle with Andariel requires 
more than thick skin and a strong will. 
You'll want armor and weaponry forged 
with the hammer's enchantments.
 
  157 89
The Malus is a Horadric artifact of 
great power. Please bring it back.
 
  158 90
I have heard that you bear us no Malus.
 
  159 120
What better opportunity to show your 
mettle?
 
  160 59
The magical effects imbued by the 
Malus are impossible to predict, but 
are always to the good.
 
  161 57
Well done, my friend. But remember, the 
return of the Horadric Malus is but one 
step in reclaiming the Monastery.
 
  162 74
Now that the Horadric Malus is back in 
our possession, we shall use it to 
deliver a great blow against the Evil 
which torments this land.
 
  163 72
Oh! Thanks so much for returning the 
Horadric Malus! I will now imbue one of 
your items with magical powers.
 
  164 120
I guess it's too late to take back some 
of the names I called you.
 
  165 118
I am glad the hammer has returned and 
you with it.
 
  166 34
It is certain that we face the demon 
queen, Andariel, who has corrupted the 
Rogue Sisterhood and defiled their 
ancestral Monastery. This does not 
bode well for us, my friend.
 
Ancient Horadric texts record that 
Andariel and the other Lesser Evils 
once overthrew the three Prime Evils -- 
Diablo, Mephisto and Baal -- banishing 
them from Hell to our world. Here, they 
caused mankind untold anguish and 
suffering before they were finally 
bound within the Soulstones.
 
Andariel's presence here could mean 
that the forces of Hell are once again 
aligned behind Diablo and his Brothers. 
If this is true, then I fear for us all.
 
You must kill her before the Monastery 
becomes a permanent outpost of Hell 
and the way east lost forever.
 
  167 45
Diablo is heading east for some foul 
purpose. And the only passage east is 
through the Monastery gate. 
Obviously, Diablo summoned Andariel 
to block any pursuit.
 
For her part Andariel hopes to win 
Diablo's favor... the lesser demons are 
always vying for positions of power 
within the unholy hierarchy!
 
  168 63
Andariel has desecrated all we hold 
dear. She must not be permitted to 
serve Diablo.
 
Destroy her! Her corruption of our 
Order must be undone!
 
  169 132
Send Andariel back to the Hell she came 
from!
 
  170 71
You're going after Andariel?
 
... One of my wagon wheels is in need of 
repair. I'll be under the wagon, if I'm 
needed.
 
  171 72
The mapmakers tell us the shortest 
distance between two points is a 
straight line.
 
Our way east is a line that runs through 
Andariel's stronghold, the Monastery.
 
  172 81
I can imagine a thousand different ways 
to kill Andariel. You need only choose 
one.
 
  173 48
It is clear that Andariel is acting on 
behalf of Diablo to prevent anyone 
from following him eastward. Her 
defeat would allow you to continue the 
pursuit.
 
Ancient lore has it that while Andariel 
was spawned in the Burning Hells, she 
is not fond of fire.
 
  174 57
You have done much to help us, but I 
sense that this has only fueled 
Andariel's fury. She will not stop until 
we are all dead.
 
You must kill Andariel before her army 
can gain the upper hand.
 
  175 72
Have you stumbled upon that Demon 
Queen, yet? I hear she's quite the 
beauty... as far as Maidens of Anguish 
go, that is.
 
  176 108
If you are the hero that you seem to be, 
now is the time to prove it.
 
  177 90
May I remind you that my caravan can 
only go east, if the Monastery is 
cleansed?
 
  178 126
Deckard Cain has important information 
about Andariel.
 
  179 64
Finally, we may rejoice!
 
We owe you a debt we can never repay. 
I only hope that in time we will be able 
to rebuild our Order.
 
All our thanks go with you, my friend.
 
  180 86
You'll probably go east now... It was 
good to know you. I hope you'll come 
back if you ever need anything.
 
  181 44
Andariel's death brings about renewed 
life for us all. We mourn the loss of our 
dear Sisters, but at least now we can 
get on with our lives.
 
I... may have misjudged you, outlander. 
You are a true hero and testament to 
the noble spirit which has inspired our 
Order for generations.
 
Fare well... my friend.
 
  182 100
I'm going to party like it's 999!
 
  183 82
The caravan is prepared. We may now 
journey eastward to Lut Gholein.
 
  184 38
This is a great victory indeed, but many 
more battles await. I will accompany 
you on your journey, lending what 
assistance I can... 
 
Remember... Diablo is still out there, 
seeking something in the desert. I'm 
afraid that this nightmare will not end 
until you find what it is that he seeks.
 
  185 600
Halt.
 
  186 290
You may not pass.
 
  187 255
Welcome to the palace.
 
  188 255
You may enter the palace.
 
  189 290
Stay out of trouble.
 
  190 58
I'll bet you wonder how this town 
manages to stay safe with all the 
trouble going on out in the desert. 
Well, I can tell you that it's got nothing 
to do with the local town guards... 
they're all in the palace for some 
reason.
 
Jerhyn hired me and my mercenaries to 
help keep the peace around here. We're 
not cheap, but we're the best this 
wasteland has to offer.
 
  191 85
We do a good job in town, but beyond 
the city gates, you'll find all manner of 
demons.
 
  192 52
The local guards were all relocated to 
the palace after the troubles began. No 
one really knows why. Actually, all of 
the town's brothel girls have been 
hiding out in the palace's cellar lately, 
so I assume that the guards have been 
assigned to 'protect them' with their 
lives.
 
  193 75
I might spare you a few of my men. 
Why, enough gold can muster an army.
 
  194 61
Jerhyn's got a nice little trading post 
going here. Despite his youth, he is a 
clever businessman. As you can see by 
that palace, he's done quite well for 
himself.
 
  195 99
We're keeping the town safe and tight, 
but I've got a hunch there's something 
Jerhyn's not telling us.
 
  196 44
Ah, Elzix is quite a character. I had a 
few run-ins with his band of outlaws in 
my younger years. Now, he's as settled 
as the dunes out there. The Desert Rain 
Inn is his pride and joy these days.
 
  197 53
Atma seems to be a fine woman. But I'm 
sure the loss of her family has made 
her lonely. Perhaps I should go over 
and console her when I get off duty 
tonight...
 
  198 72
Geglash is an imposing warrior, but he's 
never been able to back down from a 
fight. One of these days, his pride will 
be the death of him.
 
  199 67
Meshif has sailed all around the 
southern seas and visited many 
strange lands. It must be driving him 
mad, having to stay anchored here.
 
  200 70
I haven't talked much to Fara. She 
keeps to herself most of the time. I get 
the feeling that she doesn't like us 
mercenary types much.
 
  201 73
I'd stay clear of Lysander, if I were you. 
He's always mixing his damned potions 
and chemicals. I wouldn't be surprised 
if he winds up blowing himself to 
smithereens!
 
  202 85
Drognan's a mystery to me. Then again, 
I never did trust mages much.
 
  203 61
Hmm... You look like a sturdy 
adventurer.
 
You know, I used to be quite the 
scoundrel in my day. I led the fiercest 
group of bandits who ever terrorized 
these sands!
 
Nowadays, I run this here Inn and 
pretty much stay out of trouble.
 
My days of adventuring are behind me.
 
  204 48
Ah... You must be one of the new 
heroes who've come to rid our city of 
evil. Under any other circumstances, I'd 
be surprised to see one of your kind in 
the city. But lately... Oh, never mind all 
that...
 
You know, I used to be quite the 
scoundrel in my day. I led the fiercest 
group of bandits who ever terrorized 
these sands!
 
Nowadays, I run this here Inn and 
pretty much stay out of trouble.
 
My days of adventuring are behind me.
 
  205 52
You know, I've lost a number of body 
parts over the years. An eye here, a leg 
there...
 
Say, do you know any spells that'd grow 
them back for me? Hmm... On second 
thought, I'll leave well enough alone.
 
  206 90
What tales Drognan can tell... You 
would do well to listen carefully to that 
wizened wizard.
 
  207 80
There are many ancient tombs in the 
desert. Most of them are already 
plundered, but I imagine that some 
have remained hidden.
 
  208 67
I miss the brothels that used to do 
business here.
 
You know, all of the ladies fled to the 
palace as soon as the trouble in the 
desert started. You'd think that they 
could at least come out once in a while 
now that Greiz and his men have things 
relatively under control.
 
  209 71
Atma... Now, there's a fine woman. 
Lately, though, she's only thinking 
about revenge. She has reason 
enough...
 
  210 71
We've all fared well under Jerhyn's 
leadership. The town has remained 
safe throughout this whole mess; and 
yet the lad still seems very upset about 
something.
 
  211 88
Geglash is a fool who would fight his 
own shadow if he could. Fighting's all 
he ever thinks about!
 
  212 74
Meshif is a wise Captain, I think. Wise 
enough to know silver from tin and 
truth from dung, that's for sure.
 
  213 65
Fara is a good woman. She seems very 
sad, but seldom speaks of her past. 
She's good to the poor and helps 
people when she can. That makes her 
all right in my book.
 
  214 70
That Lysander's a grumpy old cuss. 
You'd better not disturb him while he's 
working on his potions, or... BOOM! 
You could get blasted to the moon.
 
  215 62
Now that Andariel is dead, I can return 
and outfit the Rogues properly. Once 
I've made some trades here, I'll be free 
to head back to their Monastery. Let 
me know if you want to travel along.
 
  216 106
Caravans take people where they want 
to go - until they get there.
 
  217 80
By ship is the only way eastward from 
here. I believe Captain Meshif has a 
small trading vessel moored at the 
docks.
 
  218 70
There used to be a lot of brothels 
here... I guess the troubles scared all 
the women away, or maybe they're 
'safe' in Jerhyn's palace.
 
  219 53
That old desert fox, Elzix, is as crafty 
as they come. Years back, he made off 
with a small fortune of my caravan's 
wares. I certainly never expected to see 
him so... domesticated.
 
  220 57
Jerhyn has his father's strength and 
wits. He's young, but he rules this 
place with wisdom and care. I think 
he'll grow into a fine Sultan... Provided 
we all survive this crisis.
 
  221 59
You'll forgive me if I seem upset. I've 
suffered a loss recently, but that's not 
your problem.
 
It's a relief to see some proper warriors 
come through here. My name is Atma. I 
run the tavern here in Lut Gholein.
 
  222 86
Evil has laid siege to Lut Gholein and 
you may be our last hope...
 
  223 56
This public house used to be quite lively, 
until this plague of evil. Luckily, I've 
managed to save away a tidy nest egg. 
Unfortunately, I couldn't save 
everything I cared for...
 
  224 57
In addition to my public house, there 
used to be several brothels doing 
business here. When the troubles first 
started in the desert, the harem guilds 
sought sanctuary within the palace.
 
Of course, Jerhyn was glad to oblige. I'll 
bet they're finding many ways to repay 
him for his protection.
 
  225 70
Geglash may seem like a sot, but he's a 
brave man. All this trouble has driven 
him to drinking more than his usual.
 
  226 64
Elzix and I have reached an 
understanding over the years. He 
sends travelers to me for drink and 
entertainment, and I send them back to 
him for a soft bed. The travelers often 
trade their wares for lodging.
 
  227 89
Meshif seldom patronizes my 
establishment. I think he prefers to 
stay out there on his leaky ship.
 
  228 71
Oh, Lysander is cranky, but he's a good 
old man. He used to give me medicines 
when... my son was ill.
 
  229 78
Drognan is a very private person. He's 
always studying ancient scrolls and 
such. He may be a mystery to me 
forever.
 
  230 57
Bah! I don't know why you people keep 
pestering me.
 
Greiz seems to have this place locked 
down nice and tight. Not that I couldn't 
have done the same! I've proven my 
valor in combat plenty of times.
 
  231 43
Hey, you're a Barbarian, aren't ya? 
Ferocious as the wild beasts of the 
north, that's what they say. I suppose 
you've come to help save this city. You 
needn't bother.
 
Greiz seems to have this place locked 
down nice and tight. Not that I couldn't 
have done the same! I've proven my 
valor in combat plenty of times.
 
  232 46
Hey, I heard that you Barbarians can 
wield multiple weapons at once. I never 
learned to fight two-handed. Carrying a 
sword and a wineskin at the same time 
is all I can ever handle.
 
  233 53
Sure, I hear lots of what goes on. Did 
you hear about the harem guilds? They 
were the only ones allowed to hide out 
in the palace when the raids started!
 
Ah... It figures.
 
  234 64
I've killed plenty of those demons out in 
the desert. It doesn't seem to slow 
them down any, though... they just 
keep coming back for more.
 
  235 55
Have you found those big sand maggots 
yet? Arrows and all that don't work so 
well against them. Best thing is to hack 
'em with a sword or such.
 
  236 58
There are some ancient tombs out there 
in the desert. You have to go pretty far 
to find them, though. Rumor has it that 
they're crawling with walking corpses 
now.
 
As if the Saber Cats and Claw Vipers 
weren't bad enough.
 
  237 67
Yeah. Meshif's okay, I guess. But I'll be 
damned if I ever get on his ship. I don't 
even like to drink water.
 
  238 52
Jerhyn's been acting strange lately. I 
can't imagine why he recalled the town 
guards into the palace. If there is 
something wrong in there, I hope he 
doesn't expect me to handle it.
 
  239 57
I've seen Fara defend herself against a 
few drunken ruffians. She's got moves 
I've never even seen before. Wherever 
she's from, she sure learned how to 
fight there.
 
  240 83
I've got no time for old alchemists. 
Lysander would be completely useless 
in a real fight.
 
  241 63
Greetings. I'm Meshif, captain of this 
ship here. I make port runs around the 
Twin Seas and occasionally out to 
Kingsport in Westmarch.
 
I haven't sailed anywhere lately, 
though... Jerhyn has ordered me to 
stay docked here in case of emergency.
 
  242 54
Greetings, Amazon. I haven't seen one 
of your kind in many years.... It's good 
to know that warriors of your caliber 
are protecting this city.
 
I'm Meshif, captain of this ship here. I 
make port runs around the Twin Seas 
and occasionally out to Kingsport in 
Westmarch.
 
I haven't sailed anywhere lately, 
though... Jerhyn has ordered me to 
stay docked here in case of emergency.
 
  243 62
I was wondering if you've heard any 
news from Kurast? I know you 
Amazons travel extensively. Have you 
been there recently?
 
Hmm... Well, I hope the port opens 
soon. I need to get home to Kurast and 
find out what's been happening there.
 
  244 72
There's something Jerhyn's not telling 
me, I just don't know what. To my eye, 
things here in town don't look that bad, 
especially since Warriv's caravan route 
opened up.
 
  245 65
I've been all around the seas in these 
parts. It's dangerous sailing west this 
time of year, though. Until the season 
changes, the caravan through the 
desert is the main trade route to 
Westmarch.
 
  246 75
My ship is the only way East from here. 
Still, Lord Jerhyn tells me that I may 
not leave until the current crisis is 
over.
 
  247 65
Oh, I've known Elzix for years. He 
always offers me a free room at his Inn 
when I dock here, but I prefer the 
comforts of my own cabin.
 
  248 61
Warriv is a good friend. We've shared 
many tales, he and I. If we had it all to 
do over again, I believe we'd both be 
explorers of some renown.
 
  249 69
Greiz seems to be a dependable fellow. I 
hope he can handle it if those things in 
the desert decide to attack this town.
 
  250 130
Atma serves a fine ale in her 
establishment.
 
  251 70
Hah! That braggart Geglash says he 
fears neither man nor beast. Yet, when 
I offer to take him out to sea, he 
quakes with fear.
 
  252 130
The lady Fara has a proud, noble air 
about her.
 
  253 41
Greetings, honored traveler. I am 
Jerhyn, Lord of Lut Gholein, and I bid 
you welcome to my fair port-city. I'm 
glad to know that once again caravans 
are free to travel through the Western 
Pass.
 
For some time now, we have been under 
siege by an evil power that I cannot 
identify. Strange... It all began when a 
Dark Wanderer came this way, looking 
for the Tomb of Tal Rasha. No one 
knows exactly where Tal Rasha, Keeper 
of Baal, is entombed, but it is certain 
to be far out in the desert.
 
Now, my people whisper tales of the 
dead rising from their tombs and 
horrible creatures lurking amongst the 
moonlit dunes. Even I have witnessed 
things which I cannot explain. I've 
ordered the port closed and all trade 
ships moored until I am sure that my 
city is safe.
 
Atma, the tavernkeeper, has an 
important mission for you. Go see her 
immediately. You'll find her on the 
other side of town.
 
Now, I must return to the palace. I 
apologize, but I can't invite you in. 
Things are... rather a mess right now.
 
  254 51
For trade in magic and the like, see 
Drognan or Lysander. Drognan is the 
wisest man I know - without equal in 
magic and ancient lore. Poor Lysander 
is nearly deaf, but he's a reliable potion 
chemist.
 
For travel back west, see Warriv, whom 
you already know.
 
Our own Fara is a fine and honest 
armorer, and she can heal wounds as 
well.
 
Elzix is the Innkeeper and may also 
have some items to trade.
 
Greiz, the mercenary captain I hired to 
secure the gates of Lut Gholein, keeps 
order in town, as well.
 
There are others here, too. I'm sure 
you'll meet most of them. Just look 
around...
 
  255 117
Things are getting worse by the hour. I 
know everything looks fine, but trust 
me, it isn't!
 
  256 117
Things are getting worse by the hour. I 
know everything looks fine, but trust 
me, it isn't!
 
  257 63
To any who aid me in the defense of Lut 
Gholein, I pledge my support. Passage 
East, wealth, honor - all are due to 
those who help my city.
 
  258 71
You seem very capable, but no offense 
is intended when I say that I must 
choose my confidants carefully. It 
wouldn't do to have rumors sending 
everyone into a panic.
 
  259 87
Even though he was once a bandit, I 
permitted Elzix to take over the Desert 
Rain Inn. He has been quite civilized 
ever since.
 
  260 76
When you arrived, Warriv's caravan had 
been long overdue. With all of the evil 
that's arisen in the land, I'm surprised 
he got through at all.
 
  261 77
Meshif is an honorable man, but I fear 
that he is growing impatient with me 
about impounding his ship. I dare not 
tell him what's really happening in this 
city.
 
  262 98
The woman, Atma, may have some 
useful gossip for you. She can always 
be found near her public house.
 
  263 81
I know much about the ancient 
religions. I was trained as a Paladin of 
Zakarum in the Eastern Kurast temple 
many years ago.
 
  264 103
Welcome, brother Paladin.
 
I am Fara. I was once a devout 
champion of Zakarum.
 
  265 67
Perhaps, in time, you will play a part in 
reclaiming our Order's honor and 
spirit. You are an inspiration to me, 
brother Paladin.
 
  266 60
The shrines in the desert are leftover 
artifacts from the great Sin War that 
ravaged these lands almost a thousand 
years ago. They still function, but most 
travelers believe them only to be 
remnants of the distant past.
 
  267 54
I've no love for brothels, as they can 
lead honorable men to do dishonorable 
things. Since the local harems took up 
hiding in the palace, however, there 
seems to be a rise in foul tempers.
 
  268 66
When the Three Evils were bound ages 
ago, Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred, was 
moved to Kurast and bound by the 
holiest of magics.
 
  269 79
Warriv may not remember me, but I 
helped him out when I was a young 
Paladin. There's no need for me to 
remind him. The rewards for honor will 
not come in this life.
 
  270 68
Greiz is a fine warrior and leader, but in 
his heart, he will always be a 
mercenary for hire. I cannot be loyal to 
those who have no loyalty to 
themselves.
 
  271 90
Atma is a good, loving woman. But I 
fear she will succumb to her despair 
and hatred.
 
  272 95
Geglash is too confident in his abilities. 
A warrior's true strength is in his 
heart.
 
  273 94
Meshif is an honest man as far as I can 
tell. He has never pestered me about 
my past.
 
  274 61
How do I know I can trust you? Hmm?
 
You may be as shifty as that pack rat, 
Elzix, who runs the Inn. But, if you 
need a potion, though, I suppose I can 
make you one... for a price, of course.
 
  275 109
Potions are delicate mixtures. They're 
just as liable to go off in your face as 
anything.
 
  276 65
Ah... The sweetest desert flower - that's 
Atma. Even my strongest brew can't 
bring back her family, though.
 
  277 86
There are some ancient enchanted 
fountains in the desert that can heal 
your wounds - if you drink enough from 
them.
 
  278 71
Oh. Deafness has its advantages, you 
know. I'm no longer forced to overhear 
the tedious gossip of others.
 
  279 54
I never patronized the brothels, mind 
you. But since those ladies took up 
hiding in the palace, there certainly has 
been less scenery to feast my eyes on.
 
  280 95
Oh... I have great faith in Greiz. He 
seems to have things well in hand.
 
  281 90
I've traded my potions to Warriv many 
times. Yes. They seem to fetch a good 
price in the western lands.
 
  282 71
I've sold many sea-sickness potions to 
Meshif over the years. It seems that 
many of his passengers don't take well 
to the rocking of his ship on the open 
seas.
 
  283 58
Oh... Young Jerhyn used to purchase 
minor love potions from me, hoping to 
win the favors of the harem girls.
 
But now that the girls have taken up 
residence in the palace, he doesn't 
come around here anymore. Well, 
well... I've always said, 'alchemy is no 
substitute for experience'.
 
  284 57
Drognan? Oh.. He's a good friend of 
mine. I help him find exotic spell 
components and alchemical books from 
time to time. I think he used to be a 
sorcerer of great renown, but he 
doesn't like to talk about his past.
 
  285 61
I've heard that you are responsible for 
banishing Andariel back to the Burning 
Hells. I'm impressed, stranger. That 
couldn't have been easy.
 
My name is Drognan and I know what 
you're up against, my friend.
 
You ought to look over my inventory of 
items for trade.
 
  286 50
Welcome, young Sorceress, to Lut 
Gholein. I hope your skills are a match 
for the horrors that lie beyond the 
city's walls. A mage of your limited 
experience may find the evil too great 
to withstand alone.
 
My name is Drognan and I know what 
you're up against, my friend.
 
You ought to look over my inventory of 
items for trade.
 
  287 74
Many of the Mage Clans feel that 
women shouldn't practice magic 
openly. But since you've made it this 
far, I must say that you have proven 
your right to do so.
 
  288 57
The Horadrim were a powerful Order, 
although maybe too prideful. Tal Rasha 
was one of their Order. And that 
should tell you something.
 
Any man who believes himself strong 
enough to contain one of the Prime 
Evils is in for a rude awakening, I 
should think.
 
  289 78
I have heard of your friend, Cain. He is 
the last of the Horadrim. You would do 
well to heed whatever advice he has to 
give you.
 
  290 53
Not long ago, one of my Vizjerei 
comrades, who I believed had died in 
Tristram, came to this city. He seemed 
quite insane, so I dismissed much of 
what he said.
 
However, he was able to talk his way 
into Jerhyn's palace. No one has seen 
him since. I fear that fool may have 
found something in the palace that led 
to his doom.
 
  291 68
I've been practicing magic for more 
years than you could know. I'm older 
than I look, though not so old that I 
can't conjure up a few sparks.
 
  292 67
Elzix is a sly one, I'll give him that. Of 
course, he never tries to cheat me. He 
knows what my magic skills can do.
 
  293 86
Demons have spread throughout the 
desert wasteland and threaten to 
engulf our quiet port-city.
 
  294 88
Meshif and his vessel should remain 
here, lest we risk taking demonic 
stowaways to other lands.
 
  295 58
When the recent troubles began, Lord 
Jerhyn came seeking my council. I 
advised him to close the port and put 
the town under strict watch.
 
Lately, though, he's been occupied 
within the palace. I doubt his whores 
could divert him from his civic duties 
for this long, though.
 
  296 68
Lysander is harmless enough. We keep 
each other company with our mutual 
interests, yet I don't think he could 
handle the enormity of our present 
situation.
 
  297 48
Greetings, my friend. Have you spoken 
to Jerhyn yet? He's quite a remarkable 
leader for being such a young man. 
Then again, the old blood has always 
run strong in this land.
 
  298 71
There is something about Fara that 
troubles me. Her manner is strange for 
a lonely desert-maid.
 
  299 70
Elzix is quite a scoundrel, but I like him 
all the same.
 
  300 59
I talked at length with Warriv as we 
crossed the desert from Khanduras. He 
has many fascinating tales of the 
dangers in the desert. His experience 
may be useful to you.
 
  301 57
Meshif is an interesting man. Part of 
him longs for the freedom of the open 
seas... Yet his heart belongs in his 
homeland.
 
  302 42
I thank you, mortal, for my freedom. 
But I did expect you earlier.
 
I am the Archangel Tyrael. I came here 
to prevent Diablo from freeing his 
brother, Baal. But I have failed. Now, 
Terror and Destruction roam free 
throughout your world.
 
Even now, they head towards the 
Eastern capital of Kurast - to the very 
heart of the Zakarum Temple. There 
they hope to find their eldest brother, 
Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred who was 
imprisoned there ages ago.
 
If the three Prime Evils unite, they will 
be invincible. Though it is unclear as to 
what their aims are, it is certain that 
they must be stopped at all costs.
 
I am broken and the energies that tie 
me to this world are diminishing 
rapidly.
 
You must take up this quest and 
prevent the Three Brothers from 
reuniting. You must cross the sea and 
search for Diablo and Baal in Kurast.
 
Now hurry, mortal... Time is running 
out for all of us!
 
  303 50
Hey, hero! You're asking for trouble, if 
you leave town now.
 
  304 50
I don't expect this of you, but if you 
want to help me, I would be grateful.
 
In the sewers below our city, there lurks 
a horrid creature that hungers for 
human flesh. The creature has killed 
many, including my son and my 
husband.
 
If you destroy it, I will reward you. 
Please be careful though, that beast 
has taken enough from us already.
 
The sewer entrance is through the trap 
door just up the street.
 
  305 52
I've personally found some of that 
devil's victims washed up out of the 
sewer. Often, they are missing limbs or 
a head, and their bodies have always 
been skinned.
 
At first the creature raided the town at 
night... That's how Atma lost her 
family. Now we've got him barricaded 
in the sewers.
 
You're safe up here on the surface, but 
every now and again some fool wants 
to be a hero and heads down to the 
waste tunnels with a pig-sticker.
 
  306 68
I hear that the creature kills his victims 
in order to hack off their limbs! I guess 
that makes me a less likely candidate, 
eh?
 
  307 84
I've heard tales of walking corpses out 
in the desert at night, though I've never 
actually seen one.
 
  308 77
Hey... Don't touch my drink or I'll bore a 
hole into your skull with my thumb.
 
  309 54
I believe that the creature you refer to 
is one of the ancient Horadric 
mummies from the tombs that lie 
buried beneath the desert sands. It is 
unusual for one of his kind to be so far 
away from his resting place. I sense in 
this entity a restless and malevolent 
spirit.
 
  310 62
The creature makes its lair in the 
tunnels beneath this city. He butchered 
my husband and son... I simply cannot 
bear to talk about it...
 
  311 63
There are two entrances to the sewers, 
I believe. One of them is right near 
here, down by the water beneath the 
docks. I can see it from my ship, and 
you can bet I keep an eye on it every 
night.
 
  312 53
Fara and I have been talking about the 
creature recently. From my studies, I 
have deduced that it is Radament the 
Fallen, an ancient Horadric mummy 
that has for some reason left his tomb 
to prey on mortals.
 
I'm doing some more research now. If 
you check back later, I may have some 
more insight as to his nature.
 
  313 94
I hear that beast is after body parts. 
Does he eat them? Oooh... Ghastly!
 
  314 48
The Horadrim used to mummify their 
highest mages, and infuse them with 
spells that would allow them to protect 
their tombs, even after death.
 
I have no idea why one of them would 
be acting so malevolently. Perhaps 
Drognan or Fara would know more 
about this.
 
  315 90
Death is not afraid of the living, but the 
living abhor death.
 
  316 55
I noticed a rotting, human arm floating 
in the harbor this morning. I suspected 
foul play, so I told Greiz. He didn't 
seem too concerned since there haven't 
been any folk reported missing lately.
 
  317 83
I am starting to have second thoughts 
about my request... I couldn't bear the 
thought of you losing your life on my 
behalf.
 
Please be careful.
 
  318 69
We've been meaning to send an 
organized group down there to kill that 
thing, but it would be dangerous. We 
just can't afford the chance of losing 
any men with all the trouble that's 
going on in the desert.
 
  319 65
Ah-hah! Back for a small shot of 
courage... Believe me, it doesn't help 
for long.
 
Drinks, barkeep!
 
  320 69
If you're going to fight that thing, use 
some common sense. Be knowledgeable 
about what harms the undead. Poison, 
for instance, will have little effect.
 
  321 64
Huh? Peppermint? Oh, Radament! Yes, 
yes. Ooh, a foul creature...
 
Some of my exploding potions should do 
quite nicely against him. They usually 
work well against the undead.
 
  322 49
I've just been reading something 
interesting about this sort of undead. 
Apparently, certain Horadric funereal 
priests altered the bodies of their dead 
mages with magical and surgical 
techniques -- often replacing body 
parts with those of animals.
 
This was thought to augment their 
powers, and raise their status in the 
afterlife.
 
  323 68
Drognan told me something interesting 
earlier today. It might explain why 
Radament is so restless, and it might 
have something to do with why he is 
stealing human body parts.
 
  324 41
The Horadric mummies were created to 
protect the tombs, but Radament is far 
from his burial chamber. Given the 
aberrations that have been witnessed 
lately, it comes as no surprise that 
even the ancient guardian spells have 
begun to unravel. Be wary of this as 
you venture farther into the desert.
 
  325 76
You've killed Radament, eh? That's quite 
a nice piece of work! If you ever need a 
job as a mercenary, I'd be happy to 
sign ya' up.
 
  326 52
From what you tell me, it would seem 
that Radament was bent on the task of 
reviving his own mummified corpse 
with the flesh of the living.
 
This is very unusual indeed. It takes an 
incredible magic power to alter the 
singular purpose of an undead mind.
 
Perhaps there is a power at work here 
which is beyond my ken.
 
  327 61
Uh... Little of what I am able to hear is 
of any value. Radament's death, 
however, is news worth hearing. I'm 
sure Atma will be glad to hear of this.
 
  328 62
Good job mate! At night out on my ship, 
I was often awakened by that fiend's 
awful moaning. I bet I rest easier now.
 
  329 41
Whoah oh... 'Radament the Fallen', is it?
 
I've fallen off many a barstool and no 
one calls me 'Geglash the Fallen'. They 
might go so far as to say, 'Geglash, 
you've fallen!'
 
  330 70
We ran into one of those old tomb 
guardians when I ran with my bandits. 
I know they aren't easy foes to face, so 
you sure have my respect. Have you 
told Atma yet?
 
  331 142
Atma's been telling everyone what 
you've done for her.
 
  332 102
As you have helped Atma and all of us, 
so shall I help you.
 
  333 57
If you haven't already, tell Atma that 
Radament is dead. It may help to ease 
the weight of her mourning.
 
  334 50
They say that the taste of vengeance is 
bittersweet, but I find it to my liking. 
 
In addition to my undying gratitude, I 
have spoken on your behalf with the 
rest of the townspeople. The 
merchants have agreed to show their 
gratitude by offering their wares and 
services at lower rates.
 
Oh... Jerhyn wants to see you, too. 
You'll find him in front of the palace.
 
  335 37
Ahh... The lost Horadric Scroll! What a 
fortunate turn of events...
 
As the last living Horadrim, I alone have 
knowledge of its meaning. Now, to read 
the Horadric runes it bears. Hmmm...
 
The Horadric Mages, after binding Baal 
within Tal Rasha, magically sealed off 
his Burial Chamber from the mortal 
realm. Those same Mages also crafted 
fearsome Horadric Staves and imbued 
them with the special power to open 
the Chamber's hidden door.
 
After nearly losing one to the thievery 
of a rogue sorcerer, they divided all 
the Horadric Staves into two parts - 
wooden shaft and metal headpiece - 
hiding them separately to safeguard 
them.
 
The Horadrim foresaw our current 
plight and designed the hiding places 
to reveal themselves to worthy heroes 
like you.
 
Collect both parts of a Horadric Staff 
and unite them using a Horadric Cube. 
Then, you may enter Tal Rasha's Burial 
Chamber.
 
  336 50
The Viper Amulet you bear is actually 
the headpiece of a Horadric Staff!
 
Yes... You have an uncanny knack for 
finding rare and valuable artifacts. Of 
course, you'll have to use a Horadric 
Cube to combine the headpiece with the 
shaft.
 
  337 56
The Staff of Kings! You astound me, my 
friend. You have discovered the shaft 
portion of a Horadric Staff.
 
I trust you know how to use a Horadric 
Cube to unite the shaft with its 
headpiece.
 
  338 40
You have quite a treasure there in that 
Horadric Cube. According to Horadric 
lore, the Cube can restore a Horadric 
Staff.
 
To do it - use the Cube as you would a 
scroll. When the Cube opens, place 
both pieces of the Staff into it and use 
the Cube's transmute power.
 
You'll be pleased to know that the Cube 
has other alchemical uses as well...
 
Six gems plus one sword transmute into 
a socketed long sword.
 
You may also transmute two quivers of 
crossbow bolts into one quiver of 
arrows, while two quivers of arrows 
yield one quiver of bolts.
 
I must leave it to you to discover other 
formulae.
 
  339 46
Excellent! You have a Horadric Staff.
 
Carry it with you into Tal Rasha's Tomb. 
Find within the Tomb the chamber 
whose floor is inset with the Circle of 
Seven Symbols.
 
Place the Staff into the receptacle you 
find there. That will open the secret 
passage into Tal Rasha's Burial 
Chamber.
 
But, be prepared for a fight - you'll 
likely have to kill Tal Rasha to destroy 
Baal.
 
  340 110
My astrologers failed to predict this 
eclipse. You should seek Drognan's 
advice.
 
  341 71
This midday darkness reeks of foul 
magic! My men and I are trying to keep 
the peace, but this kind of thing really 
scares people.
 
  342 65
Two men arrived late last night bearing 
a story about evil magic. They said 
they saw a gathering of giant snake 
creatures performing some arcane 
ritual. They sound like the Serpent Men 
of the desert.
 
  343 72
The sun has grown disgusted with the 
terrible deeds it must shine upon each 
day. Damnation is upon us all.
 
  344 121
Drognan, the wizard, will have some 
idea as to what is happening.
 
  345 100
This whole place is one big ale fog.
 
  346 70
This unnatural nightfall is no doubt 
caused by evil sorcery. Drognan might 
know what we are dealing with.
 
  347 65
Claw Vipers! This outer darkness 
mirrors the inner blackness of their 
souls. It is they who have eclipsed the 
sun, I'll wager. They are a venomous 
band.
 
  348 77
I've been researching this lengthy 
eclipse and I believe it to be the work 
of Claw Vipers.
 
Find their temple beneath the desert 
sands and you may find the source of 
this curse.
 
  349 76
This permanent darkness is very 
unsettling. Hmmm... It would make 
navigation by stars easier for me, 
though.
 
  350 62
Drognan may have some advice on this 
matter. Hmm... I think I'll speak with 
him myself.
 
  351 130
This eclipse is a definite manifestation 
of evil.
 
  352 73
Don't worry! My men and I have an iron 
grip on this town. If those cursed Claw 
Vipers are plotting anything against 
us, we'll be prepared for 'em.
 
  353 73
The calculated coldness of the reptilian 
brain makes the Claw Vipers uncanny 
adversaries.
 
  354 49
It's strange when the morning after the 
night before... is still the same night.
 
  355 105
I've had about enough of this darkness. 
I don't even know what day it is 
anymore.
 
  356 77
The Claw Vipers practice evil magic. 
They have also been known to kidnap 
travelers and sacrifice them to their 
dark gods.
 
  357 82
Well... I don't know much about the 
habits of Claw Vipers, to be honest. 
Drognan will probably know something 
about the nature of the magic at work.
 
  358 51
I've discovered a reference to a similar 
eclipse several hundred years ago. It 
says that some desert-dwelling snake 
demons had erected an evil altar, 
which caused the sun to go black.
 
Perhaps we are dealing with something 
similar here. Look for an altar in the 
Claw Viper temple.
 
  359 94
I usually charge for rooms by the night.
 
But I may have to soon change that.
 
  360 57
The source of this spell is probably a 
magical altar. It will not be enough to 
kill the Claw Vipers. To reverse the 
spell you must destroy the altar.
 
  361 80
I was going to go to bed, but then I 
realized that I have no idea what time 
it is. It could be the crack of dawn, for 
all I know.
 
  362 96
The sun again shines on Lut Gholein! I'm 
beginning to like you, traveler.
 
  363 219
I'm glad that's over with!
 
  364 74
Ahh... It takes but one eye to revel in 
the beauty of our restored sun.
 
  365 60
So, this is daylight... It's over-rated.
 
  366 80
With renewed daylight, one may gather 
the wits that were scattered about like 
restrictive undergarments in the 
darkness.
 
  367 130
So... Did you plunder any booty?
 
  368 132
You have done well to restore light to 
our world.
 
  369 87
Drognan seems to have taken you into 
his confidence. This is good, for you 
will benefit from his wisdom.
 
  370 69
Ahhh... Claw Vipers are fond of magical 
artifacts. Did you happen to find one in 
their temple?
 
  371 69
You did well in destroying the Claw 
Vipers. We are all glad to see the sun 
returned to its former glory.
 
  372 48
I've been speaking with Lord Jerhyn, and 
I sense that he is becoming more and 
more agitated by something. You 
should try to talk to him again.
 
If he still won't take you into his 
confidence, seek to prove yourself a bit 
more. I gather that his respect for you 
is growing.
 
  373 41
I've been researching the old records, 
trying to find the location of Tal 
Rasha's Tomb. Though I haven't found 
the Tomb, itself, I may have a good 
lead for you.
 
The great Vizjerei Summoner, Horazon, 
built his Arcane Sanctuary somewhere 
around here. He was a powerful 
spellcaster and kept demons as slaves 
within the Sanctuary. He kept a close 
eye on great events, too -- such as the 
imprisonment of Baal within Tal 
Rasha's Tomb.
 
If you could find Horazon's Sanctuary, 
I'm sure that it would hold some clue 
as to the Tomb's location. Though I 
doubt Horazon is still alive, you must 
proceed with caution. There's no telling 
what could be waiting inside.
 
When I spoke of this with Lord Jerhyn, 
he asked that I send you to him. 
Perhaps he knows of a secret entrance 
or the like.
 
  374 46
Ah, the ancient mage Horazon! He 
believed that he could bend Evil forces 
to his will. What he didn't know was 
that Evil uses man, not the reverse.
 
The Vizjerei still revere him as a symbol 
of man's ability to triumph over other 
worldly forces. The Church of Light, 
however, cites him as an example of 
man's folly.
 
  375 89
The only thing in Jerhyn's cellar are the 
harem girls that have been hiding there 
since the troubles began.
 
  376 62
An 'Arcane Sanctuary' under the 
palace? I'd heard that there were some 
underground cellar levels that Jerhyn 
used as chambers for his treasure and 
such, but no Arcane Sanctuary.
 
  377 44
When the troubles began here, I allowed 
the terrified Harem guilds to join me 
within the safety of the palace. All was 
fine, until one night...
 
Screams echoed up the stairwells from 
the harem. My guards arrived to find 
the poor girls being slaughtered by a 
merciless band of hell-spawned 
demons. My brave guardsmen tried to 
push the demons back into the 
mysterious rift from which they came.
 
Ever since, my men have fought a losing 
battle. Demons have continued to pour 
through the rift into the palace. 
Ultimately, I hired Greiz and his 
mercenaries to help protect the rest of 
my fair city.
 
Drognan believes that the Arcane 
Sanctuary lies buried underneath this 
palace, since Lut Gholein occupies the 
site of an ancient Vizjerei fortress.
 
My palace is open to you now... Take 
care.
 
  378 45
I very much doubt that Horazon still 
lives in his Sanctuary. He possessed 
great power and influence over 
demons, but even that may not have 
been enough in the end. One of his 
notoriety cannot easily remove himself 
from the vengeful reach of Hell.
 
  379 60
Look, look... I'm just about as tough and 
arrogant as they come, but you'd never 
catch me trying to tame a demon for a 
pet. That's just asking for a lot of 
trouble.
 
  380 75
Arcane Sanctuary? That place sounds 
awful! Even if you find a way into it, 
what makes you think you'll be able to 
leave again?
 
  381 73
A careful caravan gives wide berth to 
sleeping bandits. If Horazon is gone, 
let him remain so.
 
  382 49
Horazon found it necessary to lock 
himself up for all time, just to protect 
himself from those angry demons. 
Such is the fate of one who practices 
the summoning arts... that, or eternal 
damnation. There's old summoners and 
bold summoners, but no old, bold 
summoners.
 
  383 42
Nearly a thousand years ago, Horazon 
rose to the fore of the Vizjerei mage 
clan. Horazon used the knowledge of 
the Vizjerei to summon and control 
demons from Hell.
 
Though a powerful Summoner, Horazon 
feared that the Lords of Hell would 
punish him for enslaving their 
brethren. Thus, the Summoner created 
for himself an Arcane Sanctuary.
 
He believed that his Sanctuary would 
not only protect him from Hell's 
vengeance, but also allow him to 
continue his studies free from the 
ravages of time and disease.
 
Horazon had crafted many wondrous 
scrying devices through which he 
observed the events of the world 
outside. It is certain that he took 
careful study of Tal Rasha's 
imprisonment and recorded the 
location of his forgotten Tomb.
 
The Arcane Sanctuary was believed to 
have been constructed here in Lut 
Gholein. An entrance may be hidden 
somewhere in the palace, as that 
building is very old, and was once a 
Vizjerei fortress.
 
  384 57
Ahh... The legend of Horazon is an old 
one, especially around these parts. You 
wouldn't believe the feats and strange 
events that are attributed to him.
 
  385 63
I understand that you've been talking to 
Jerhyn. Well, if so, then you're the first 
in a long while... since the trouble 
began, actually.
 
Do us a favor and try to find out what's 
got Jerhyn so edgy all the time. OK?
 
  386 48
There was an eastern mage... a Vizjerei, 
I believe... who visited me almost a 
year ago. He was very interested in the 
history of this site, and he seemed 
particularly fascinated with the palace 
architecture.
 
I gave him a tour. When he found the 
ancient seals over a passageway in the 
cellar, he became very agitated. He 
asked for some time alone to study 
them, and I granted it.
 
Shortly after, he left with no further 
word and I never saw him again. Odd... 
Don't you think?
 
  387 61
What's got you so occupied in the 
palace? Don't tell me you're finding the 
Harems more compelling than killing 
demons? That would be out of 
character for one such as yourself.
 
  388 63
I am certain that you will find the 
information you need when you find 
Horazon's Journal. I suggest you find it 
quickly, for Diablo may be getting 
closer to freeing his brother as we 
speak.
 
  389 68
Huh? The horizon is always out of 
reach, you should know that. Oh, 
Horazon! Oh, I see. Uh.
 
Yes. Well. He was insane. Brilliant, yes, 
but... total lunatic.
 
  390 57
Even a sanctuary such as Horazon's 
can be breached by the tentacles of 
Evil. Such a haven could have become a 
chamber of unspeakable horrors. Be 
wary of what you may unleash!
 
  391 49
All my years of brawling, of pummeling 
both the unsuspecting and the 
deserving, have yielded two insights. 
You can either fight or you can run. All 
other strategies are variations of 
these.
 
  392 77
So... Now that you're such a pal of 
Jerhyn, why don't you ask him if I can 
set sail one of these days? I'm running 
out of patience.
 
  393 87
So you've been in the palace, have you? 
Tell me, why does Jerhyn keep that 
place locked up so tight?
 
  394 87
Fate is like a caged gorilla. It will pelt 
you with dung if you mock it.
 
  395 51
I've been thinking about the problems in 
Jerhyn's palace. Perhaps this has 
occurred to you as well...
 
If those cellar passageways lead to the 
Arcane Sanctuary, then that is where 
the demons came from. Horazon's 
haven must have been breached!
 
  396 37
Seekers of the Tomb of Tal Rasha will 
find it through the Portal. But know 
that the glowing glyphs recorded here 
in my Arcane Sanctuary are the signs 
of the six False Tombs.
 
The missing Seventh Sign marks the 
Tomb of Tal Rasha... Of the Horadrim 
he might be called the foremost.
 
It was a shining - but brief - moment for 
the Mage Clans when they set aside 
their differences and worked together 
against the common enemy.
 
The Horadrim relentlessly pursued the 
Three across the desolate Empires of 
the East, and even into the uncharted 
lands of the West, leaving the 
Archangel Tyrael's hands unblemished.
 
Presuming the Three to be vanquished, 
the Horadrim's unstable fellowship 
began to dissipate. Abandoning their 
sacred charge to safeguard the three 
Soulstones, the disparate Mage Clans 
began to squabble amongst each other 
over petty differences.
 
Their conflicts not only dissolved their 
brotherhood, but strengthened the 
Evils which they had buried beneath the 
cold earth.
 
  397 59
Unbelievable! The Harem girls are dead! 
The palace guards have been fighting 
off demons from the cellar. How could 
that happen without my knowledge?
 
  398 62
I thank you for your heroic aid! I'm also 
glad that you found something you 
were looking for. The journal should 
help you find the True Tomb of Tal 
Rasha. Hopefully, there is still time to 
get there before Diablo.
 
Go now. And good luck.
 
  399 55
You have found Horazon's Journal. 
Excellent... But, I must caution you.
 
The mark of the True Tomb of Tal 
Rasha, is sought, if not already known, 
by Diablo. I needn't elaborate on the 
implications of that.
 
  400 71
News of the tragedy in the palace is 
spreading fast. How awful! And to 
think, this whole time I thought Jerhyn 
and his guards were in there playing 
with the harem girls.
 
  401 60
Hah! I wish Jerhyn would've let me in the 
palace. I would've saved those girls and 
kicked demon ass back to the fire-pits 
o' Hell!
 
  402 52
So... Now we know Jerhyn's little secret. 
Well... I guess I can see why he wanted 
me to stay, though... I'm just glad it 
didn't come to that. Now he tells me to 
wait some more, in case you need to 
get out of here.
 
Well, for you I'll do it. Maybe they'll 
mention me in the epic ballads, eh?
 
  403 67
Well, the news going around town is 
very unsettling. Apparently, we were in 
more danger than anyone thought.
 
Good work friend... you may have saved 
all our skins.
 
  404 64
Faith is stronger than any armor. The 
shield will protect the body, but Faith 
will strengthen the courageous heart.
 
  405 55
Horazon's urinal? Oh, journal! Yes, 
well... Glad you found it. Such a shame 
about those poor harem girls, huh? I 
shall miss them deeply... I mean their 
conversations, of course.
 
  406 62
Oh, those poor women! Will the 
slaughter never end? Thank you once 
again for protecting our city.
 
  407 57
You must move quickly now, friend, for 
Diablo is undoubtedly close to finding 
what he seeks. Find the Tomb of Tal 
Rasha before he frees the Lord of 
Destruction.
 
  408 89
That guy really talks like that? Sounds 
like either Horazon has gone stir-crazy 
or that's some impostor.
 
  409 57
The man you describe is probably not 
Horazon.
 
He sounds like the very mage who came 
around here a while ago. He was very 
curious about this palace and seemed 
especially interested in the seal on the 
passageway in the cellar. He left 
shortly after that. I wonder how he got 
down there? The seal was never 
broken...
 
That mage spoke a great deal to 
Drognan. Why don't you ask him about 
it?
 
  410 47
Yes... The man you speak of sounds like 
the mage who came here many months 
ago. He claimed to have fought Diablo 
in the passages beneath Tristram.
 
No doubt the fool wandered into 
Horazon's Sanctuary and lost whatever 
was left of his ravaged mind. He is 
beyond salvation. 
 
It is possible that the fool has been 
possessed by the spirit of Horazon. If 
that's true, then you'd better put an 
end to his tortured existence.
 
Once done, I believe the demons who 
were summoned and imprisoned within 
the Sanctuary will cease to exist as 
well.
 
  411 57
Ah, yes. I remember. There was a... 
fellow around here many months ago 
who asked almost as many questions 
about Horazon as you.
 
So... He discovered enough to assume 
Horazon's place in the Arcane 
Sanctuary, huh? What a fool!
 
  412 72
Ah, yes. As a ship captain I am well 
aware of the phenomenon of a false 
Horazon.
 
Sorry, just a little joke.
 
  413 99
There's nothing more dreadful than a 
powerful being driven by a frayed 
mind.
 
  414 105
You always seem to find the worst 
trouble. I don't know how you handle it.
 
  415 38
So! Horazon's crazy, eh? I'd be 
surprised if he wasn't. All those 
centuries without ale would drive 
anyone to drink... but then you couldn't 
drink. And that would drive you to 
drink... Hah?... What was the question?
 
  416 63
Hmmm... That doesn't sound like 
Horazon. I'll agree that he may have 
gone mad, but from what you tell me, I 
don't think that's the case. Talk to 
Drognan... he may know more than I.
 
  417 106
Ugh... Crazy mages give me the creeps.
 
Just kill him and get on with your 
business.
 
  418 45
The appearance of the mage you 
describe sounds like one I met back in 
Tristram. Many Vizjerei came to fight 
against Diablo, the Lord of Terror. 
Perhaps, this is one of them.
 
You know, fate seems to have frowned 
upon all of the heroes who confronted 
that terrible Evil. Take care or the 
same may happen to you.
 
  419 76
So, Horazon's been dead for some time. 
I take it you at least found what you 
were looking for.
 
  420 60
The way I see it... Well, it's all pretty 
blurry.
 
  421 63
The demonic force that was emanating 
from the corrupted Sanctuary has 
dissipated. I thank you greatly for your 
help. Now, we can look to rebuilding 
our lives.
 
All will be for nothing, though, if you do 
not stop the greater Evil which is 
rapidly gaining ground.
 
  422 83
Larger forces are moving inexorably 
towards us. You must now make haste 
to the Tombs.
 
  423 65
You make me long for the days of glory. 
When I had both hands, both eyes and 
more of a foot...
 
  424 84
I guess you'll be heading to the Tombs 
now? I hear that they're in the deepest 
desert regions.
 
  425 100
Well! You've got what you're after. Now 
get a move on before it's too late.
 
  426 103
Huhhh... Such is always the fate of 
those who meddle with evil.
 
  427 89
You're more the hero than I could have 
dreamed. Perhaps, there is hope for us 
after all.
 
  428 74
I feel no pity for that would-be 
Summoner. His terrible ambition for 
demonic power was his undoing. You 
merely hastened the inevitable.
 
  429 48
I hope that this false Summoner found 
peace in death. Unfortunately, it is 
more likely that he will be dragged 
down into Hell by the demons he was 
bound to.
 
Let this be a lesson to you... Demonic 
magic is a quick path, but its powers 
are seductive and deadly.
 
  430 45
I have heard of your many deeds of skill 
and bravery. I feel I can trust you with 
something I have been hesitant to 
speak of...
 
Drognan and I have concluded that the 
Dark Wanderer who passed through 
here recently was Diablo, himself! 
Drognan believes that Diablo is 
searching the desert for the secret 
tomb where the great Horadric mage, 
Tal Rasha, keeps Baal imprisoned.
 
You must find Diablo and put an end to 
the terrible evil that has fallen upon 
our city. Drognan is wise and is sure to 
have some helpful advice for you as to 
how Tal Rasha's tomb may be found.
 
It may take you quite some time to find 
The Tomb. May you be ready when you 
do.
 
  431 53
It is well-known that there are seven 
great Horadric tombs hidden beneath 
the sands in the furthest reaches of 
the desert. One of them surely must be 
Tal Rasha's prison. You must explore 
each of the tombs to find Tal Rasha's 
exact location.
 
Of course, Diablo is searching for the 
Tomb as well... No one can guess as to 
what terrors he has unleashed in his 
search.
 
  432 59
So... You're going to search for the 
Seven Tombs, huh? Don't you know 
that they're just desert legends passed 
between merchants and travelers? No 
one really believes that they exist.
 
  433 61
Be very careful, my friend. I think I've 
seen enough recently not to doubt that 
these Tombs exist. And if they do, 
they're most certainly guarded by 
terrible creatures.
 
  434 67
I've heard legends of the Tomb of Tal 
Rasha, but I thought they were just old 
tales meant to scare young children.
 
  435 59
Ohh... I'd go with ya' to those tombs... 
But... umm... I don't like all that living 
dead stuff.
 
  436 84
I'm sorry, I can't help you much here. 
Now, if the tombs were across the 
ocean, then I'd be the guy to talk to.
 
  437 57
Legend has it that Tal Rasha lies 
imprisoned within his tomb, forever 
struggling to keep the Lord of 
Destruction bound. His was a selfless 
act, although perhaps foolhardy.
 
  438 56
When Tal Rasha chose to embody the 
spirit of Baal, he knew his doom was to 
wrestle eternally against the will of the 
greater Evil. Look around you and ask 
yourself, 'Has the battle been won or 
lost?'
 
  439 55
Tal Rasha's tomb is hidden deep in the 
desert among six others. Tal Rasha's 
symbol marks the True Tomb. If you 
want to know what that symbol is, you 
should be able to find it within the 
legendary Arcane Sanctuary.
 
  440 57
Diablo nears his goal. We have little 
time to lose.
 
Remember, my friend, that Andariel 
gave herself willingly to Diablo's cause. 
It would be prudent to assume that the 
other Evils will attempt to aid their 
master as well.
 
  441 106
If you're going into the deep desert, why 
not hire a few of my men to watch your 
back?
 
  442 47
You have done very well. Few could have 
come this far, let alone discover the 
True Tomb of Tal Rasha. Unfortunately, 
I hear that Diablo and Baal have eluded 
your grasp. This is most unfortunate...
 
If you wish to travel East, I have 
authorized Meshif to give you passage 
by sea. I imagine he should be very 
anxious to leave by now.
 
Good luck on your quest, and thank you 
again for saving my beloved city. You 
will always be welcome in Lut Gholein, 
my friend.
 
  443 71
I heard that Diablo has managed to 
best you, at least for the time being. I 
hope you catch up with him soon, and 
send him back to Hell for good!
 
  444 70
I'm sorry things didn't turn out as you 
had hoped. Go and remember us 
fondly. You know, you bothered me far 
less than most.
 
  445 64
You have proven to be the greatest of 
heroes, and I am honored to call you 
friend. Thank you for bringing peace to 
our lives again.
 
  446 68
Never fear, my friend. You did the best 
you could.
 
I suspect that Diablo and Baal are now 
heading east, towards Kurast. You'll 
find them... I know you will.
 
  447 46
This is terrible news! Baal is in 
possession of one of mankind's most 
powerful mages, and the Lord of Terror 
guides his path. They must be stopped, 
for I am sure they mean to free their 
elder brother Mephisto, the Lord of 
Hatred, who lies imprisoned under the 
corrupted city of Kurast.
 
I fear you are walking into a great evil, 
but your faith can save you. May you 
walk in the light always.
 
  448 54
You're an inspiration! And such a hero 
that it makes me look twice as bad...
 
Ahh, you're OK... Hey! Just save some 
glory for us little guys, huh?
 
  449 51
This is a serious setback... It is most 
unfortunate that Tal Rasha has been 
consumed by Baal's destructive 
influence. There are many secrets 
known to the Horadrim, which could be 
used by Baal against us.
 
You must travel east by sea to Kurast 
and stop Diablo and Baal before they 
free their eldest brother, Mephisto.
 
Hahh... The lands of the eastern Empire 
are not the same as they used to be. 
There has been little word for some 
time.
 
Speed is of the essence. Go quickly, my 
friend. May the fates smile on you.
 
  450 82
Jerhyn tells me I should take you east to 
Kurast. I haven't been there for several 
years, but rumor has it that things are 
pretty grim.
 
  451 51
I've heard that your foe got away from 
you this time. Well, look at it this way... 
you've got the demons on the run. If 
you're going to be leaving, then... Well, 
thanks for your help.
 
  452 39
The Archangel Tyrael was the one who 
gave the Soulstones to the Horadrim 
two hundred and sixty years ago.
 
It is highly unusual for the forces of 
Heaven to so directly interfere with 
man's destiny, but Tyrael was said to 
act of his own volition. We have never 
been able to discern why.
 
Perhaps, he goes against the consensus 
of Heaven because he doubts our 
ability to defend ourselves, or perhaps, 
he sees more threat than his peers.
 
Where the actions of Hell often seem 
straightforwardly bent on destruction, 
the motives of Heaven are 
unfathomable.
 
Now make haste... Both Diablo and Baal 
must be stopped before they join with 
their brother, Mephisto. If the three 
Prime Evils unite once again, the world 
as we know it will be no more.
 
  453 48
Greetings, hero. I've heard of your 
exploits and... I'm quite impressed. 
Very few mortals are capable of 
dealing with the Three and their 
minions as you have.
 
My name is Natalya. I am a hunter of 
Evil, part of an ancient Order sworn to 
hunt down corrupted sorcerers.
 
If I could, I would gladly join your quest 
to stop the Three. But I must wait here 
for further news. I can't predict what 
will happen, but the danger is greater 
than we can know.
 
Until I receive my orders, I'll assist you 
with the information I have.
 
  454 74
Asheara...? Oh, she's is a tough-talking 
mage, but I'd wager she's never faced 
true Evil.
 
Pampering drunken mercenaries is one 
thing, but standing face to face with a 
hell-spawned demon is another.
 
  455 69
I've heard the name of Deckard Cain 
many times. He's the last of the 
Horadrim, and thus, I must honor him. 
You must be powerful, indeed, if one 
such as he accompanies you.
 
  456 100
Hratli is a master craftsman. My Order 
could make use of one with his unique 
skills.
 
  457 67
My Order has been keeping watch over 
Ormus for many years, now. He seems 
to champion the cause of good, but 
who knows what shadow lurks within 
his soul?
 
  458 45
I've not set foot in glorious Kurast for 
many years. But I never would have 
imagined it could be so corrupted.
 
Certainly, this must be Mephisto's work! 
You'd best get going, my friend. Diablo 
and Baal are still out there and you 
must find them.
 
  459 62
Seeing his homeland in such a state 
must be horrifying to Meshif. I'm 
surprised he's willing to remain here in 
order to help you.
 
  460 82
Asheara seems like a very tough 
woman. I'd be careful around her if I 
were you.
 
  461 53
Drognan told me of Hratli when we were 
in Lut Gholein. He said that he weaves 
magic into his forge and produces 
mystical weapons and armor.
 
His skills could be quite useful to you. 
 
  462 44
Judging from his dress and strange 
markings, I would guess that Ormus is 
from the ancient Taan mage-clan. Yet 
none of the others here seem to know 
that he is a sorcerer.
 
The Taan were once as powerful as the 
Vizjerei clan, but their studies were 
even more secretive. I wonder what 
he's hiding.
 
  463 49
Have you met, Natalya? She appears to 
be a member of the Khral-Harzhek, a 
secret order that has been around for 
centuries... almost as long as the 
Horadrim, itself.
 
Her presence here makes me uneasy, 
for they are traditionally sworn to hunt 
down Magi who have betrayed the trust 
of their order.
 
I wonder why she is here.
 
  464 73
Ormus would like you to think him mad. 
Better to watch his actions than listen 
to his words.
 
  465 33
Welcome to Kurast, traveler. Few come 
willingly to this ancient city anymore. I 
hope you brought your wits with you, 
for sanity is in short supply here.
 
My name is Hratli. I am a sorcerer 
skilled in metal work. It'd be a pleasure 
to help you... I don't have many 
customers these days.
 
As you can see, the populace has been 
brutally decimated by the forces of 
Mephisto. The canals run red with 
blood and demons roam the land.
 
The wretched jungle-hell has already 
reclaimed much of Kurast. The only 
safety you'll find is here at the 
dockside, where a magical warding 
holds the jungle evils at bay... but I 
don't know how long it will last.
 
To make matters worse, the Children of 
Zakarum are in league with the forces 
of Mephisto. The Zakarum have 
concentrated their power in the Temple 
City of Travincal, located within Kurast 
deep in the jungle wilderness.
 
It's true... Their zeal is unmatched. But I 
say the so-called 'Warriors of Light' are 
nothing more than the twisted puppets 
of a hidden hand.
 
  466 33
Welcome to Kurast, young Sorceress. 
Few come willingly to this ancient city 
anymore. I hope you brought your wits 
with you, for sanity is in short supply 
here.
 
My name is Hratli. I am a sorcerer 
skilled in metal work. It'd be a pleasure 
to help you... I don't have many 
customers these days.
 
Though my own magic is only useful for 
making enchanted weapons, I'll bet 
yours will put an end to this terrible 
evil once and for all. May the spirits of 
Skatsim watch over and protect you.
 
As you can see, the populace has been 
brutally decimated by the forces of 
Mephisto. The canals run red with 
blood and demons roam the land.
 
The wretched jungle-hell has already 
reclaimed much of Kurast. The only 
safety you'll find is here at the 
dockside, where a magical warding 
holds the jungle evils at bay... but I 
don't know how long it will last.
 
To make matters worse, the Children of 
Zakarum are in league with the forces 
of Mephisto. The Zakarum have 
concentrated their power in the Temple 
City of Travincal, located within Kurast 
deep in the jungle wilderness.
 
It's true... Their zeal is unmatched. But I 
say the so-called 'Warriors of Light' are 
nothing more than the twisted puppets 
of a hidden hand.
 
  467 48
You're very brave to have come here. In 
the old days, mages who didn't belong 
to one of the great Mage Clans were 
hunted down as renegades. But now, 
the Mage Clans have little authority.
 
  468 53
Within the Temple City stands a tower 
built long ago by the Horadrim to 
imprison the... Well, you'll discover 
more about it soon enough.
 
  469 60
If you are another follower of Zakarum, 
I've told you people before I don't want 
your Towering Spire or anything else 
you have to sell!
 
  470 74
Some find my prices unreasonable. That 
is because I am unreasonable.
 
  471 76
You'll find that the Zakarumites have 
the persistence of zombies, but without 
the charisma.
 
  472 60
Asheara leads the mercenary company 
known as the Iron Wolves. You can hire 
some of them, but many are occupied 
securing the dockside.
 
  473 74
Alkor is a potion dealer given over to a 
life steeped in ceaseless study and 
dissipation.
 
  474 58
Ormus is a man of many mysteries. I 
sense strong magic about him, but he's 
never spoken of it to me.
 
  475 49
I trust you already know Meshif. But did 
you know that he was born and raised 
here?
 
I suspect that like many of us his spirit 
is near broken at the sight of Kurast's 
decline. Only our brand of gallows 
humor saves us from utter despair.
 
  476 55
This, Cain, whom you brought with you. 
He has the bearing of great power, yet 
I sense no magic about him. He is an 
enigma to me.
 
  477 49
Natalya is a quiet one. She arrived here 
about a week ago and has pretty much 
kept to herself. She's inquired about 
my weapons a few times, so I assume 
that she's a warrior of some sort.
 
  478 51
Well, I gave you my word, and brought 
you here as promised.
 
But by all that's still holy, I wish I'd 
never returned to this accursed place. 
This fetid jungle can't be the fair 
Kurast I left behind.
 
I don't know what all this evil is, my 
friend, but it's obvious that you must 
stop it. I only pray that you can before 
the jungle consumes the last vestiges 
of my beloved homeland.
 
  479 47
Being a Barbarian, I'm sure you've seen 
many strange sights in the northlands.
 
But by all that's still holy, I wish I'd 
never returned to this accursed place. 
This fetid jungle can't be the fair 
Kurast I left behind!
 
I don't know what all this evil is, my 
friend, but it's obvious that you must 
stop it. I only pray that you can before 
the jungle consumes the last vestiges 
of my beloved homeland.
 
If this evil isn't contained, it could 
spread north to your homeland, too. 
Then the whole world would fall under 
the shadow of the Three.
 
  480 63
It takes great courage and generosity 
to defend a land and a people that are 
not your own. Perhaps, when this curse 
is lifted, my people can do something 
for yours in return.
 
  481 72
I shouldn't have boasted so much about 
Kurast on the journey here. Oh... Much 
has changed since I left.
 
  482 99
The dockside is apparently the only 
civilized area left in Kurast.
 
  483 88
If you are planning to carry on your 
wild ways here, you may need the 
assistance of Asheara's Iron Wolf 
mercenaries.
 
  484 75
Your companion, Cain, must have 
known that he would be in grave 
danger here. You are great, indeed, to 
elicit such loyalty.
 
  485 81
Hratli seems to be the only one left here 
with any common sense. Yet how 
sensible is it to remain here?
 
  486 80
I went to speak with old Alkor, but I 
disturbed his studies. He doesn't seem 
to like visitors.
 
  487 73
Trying to get information out of Ormus 
is like straining water from a rock. His 
damned riddles are almost as 
confusing as our current state of 
affairs.
 
  488 75
That woman, Natalya, seems to be 
waiting for something important to 
happen. She's a strange one, I think.
 
  489 68
All through my childhood, Kurast was a 
paradise. The once perfumed air now 
reeks of putrefaction.
 
  490 54
Hello, there. You must be a great 
adventurer to risk coming here.
 
My name's Asheara, and I lead the 
mercenary band of mages known as 
the Iron Wolves. We've been hunting 
down demons in the jungle for months, 
but no matter how many of them we 
kill, they just keep comin'. Seems this 
whole place has been overrun by evil.
 
Rumor has it that you've come here to 
help. If that's true, then I'll let you hire 
some of my mercenaries.
 
But be careful... If you piss them off, 
they can be worse than those monsters 
out in the jungle.
 
  491 50
Hello, there. You must be an Amazon. 
I've heard about your people... nomadic 
warriors without peer.
 
My name's Asheara, and I lead the 
mercenary band of mages known as 
the Iron Wolves. We've been hunting 
down demons in the jungle for months, 
but no matter how many of them we 
kill, they just keep comin'. Seems this 
whole place has been overrun by evil.
 
Rumor has it that you've come here to 
help. If that's true, then I'll let you hire 
some of my mercenaries.
 
But be careful... If you piss them off, 
they can be worse than those monsters 
out in the jungle.
 
  492 66
Your skills are unique indeed. They are 
neither sorcery, nor physical, but seem 
to be a harmonious blend of the two. 
The Iron Wolves could learn much from 
your kind.
 
  493 160
Why fight fair, when you can hire some 
of us?
 
  494 107
No one comes to Kurast anymore 
without good reason.  You must be 
seeking fame and fortune.
 
  495 137
The Iron Wolves and I have made a 
good living around here lately.
 
  496 110
The jungle can take you down fast. Try 
to avoid getting trapped out there if 
you can.
 
  497 90
Hratli may be a bit too clever for his 
own good. Still, I'd trust his work 
anytime.
 
  498 77
Hratli thinks he's so funny. The other 
day he said, 'Asheara, I don't recognize 
you without that big gash on your 
face.'
 
  499 97
Meshif says he used to live here. I'm 
surprised he came back. I'll bet he 
wishes he hadn't.
 
  500 78
I invited Natalya to join the Iron Wolves 
and she began lecturing me about the 
'dangers of magic'. Who the hell does 
she think she is, anyway?
 
  501 61
Damn it, I wish you people would just 
leave me alone! I...
 
Oh, you're new here, aren't you?
 
I am Alkor, the Alchemist. I dabble in 
potions and salves, and I can sell you 
some if you really need them.
 
But don't make a habit of coming here. I 
don't like to be disturbed while I'm 
studying!
 
  502 48
Damn it, I wish you people would just 
leave me alone! I...
 
Oh, you're a Necromancer, aren't you? 
I've heard that your kind use powerful 
potions and such to wake the dead and 
control spirits. I'd love to discuss what 
components you use some time.
 
I am Alkor, the Alchemist. I dabble in 
potions and salves, myself, and I can 
sell you some if you really need them.
 
...Feel free to drop by anytime.
 
  503 55
Even I can tell that the evil in the jungle 
is growing. I hope you survive out 
there, my pasty friend. I'd still like to 
discuss what components are best 
used in necromantic potions.
 
  504 151
Care to take a gander at my Grimoire?
 
  505 90
I've never claimed that you'd live forever 
after trying one of my potions! Merely 
that you might look as though you had.
 
  506 105
I keep a library of tomes - heretical, 
exegetical, hermeneutical and 
pharmaceutical.
 
  507 50
There was a very fat man here recently 
asking after the Golden Bird of Ku 
Y'Leh. Have you heard of it? He kept 
muttering about ashes. I would imagine 
one Golden Bird's ash-hole to be about 
the same as another, wouldn't you?
 
  508 150
I hope you don't object to my badgering 
the witless.
 
  509 115
You came here with Meshif? That old 
'tour-guide to the stupid'!
 
I'm surprised you made it here in one 
piece.
 
  510 98
Oh, Asheara's a good customer. She 
buys a potion of manliness from me 
every week.
 
  511 82
Hratli's only good for making his silly 
magic weapons. It's not like he's got 
the stones to actually go out and use 
them on anything.
 
  512 88
Oh, Ormus has been talking in riddles 
for years. I think he does it to cover up 
the fact that he's got nothing 
intelligent to say.
 
  513 52
Yes, Natalya is a cute girl. However, I 
think she could use a special potion.
 
Let me see here, 'Radiant Beauty'... No. 
'Ray of Sunshine'... No, that's not it.
 
Ah, here it is: 'Relax Frosty Bitch'. This 
should help her out.
 
  514 38
You now speak to Ormus.
 
He was once a great mage, but now 
lives like a rat in a sinking vessel. You 
have questions for Ormus and doubt in 
yourself. Ormus sees a strange 
dichotomy in you... as he does in all 
would-be heroes.
 
Speak to him and he may grant you 
wisdom in turn. Or turn from him and 
seek wisdom in thyself.
 
  515 37
You now speak to Ormus, good Paladin.
 
He was once a great mage, but now 
lives like a rat in a sinking vessel. You 
have questions for Ormus and doubt in 
yourself. Ormus sees a strange 
dichotomy in you... as he does in all 
would-be heroes.
 
Speak to him and he may grant you 
wisdom in turn. Or turn from him and 
seek wisdom in thyself.
 
  516 68
The Church which you serve is 
corrupted by evil. Yet the holy 
disciplines it taught you may yet save 
us all.
 
This is a strange time for heroes, 
Ormus thinks.
 
  517 65
Your salvation can only be reached 
through Hatred. A strange fate, but a 
true one.
 
  518 52
How does one destroy Destruction? How 
does one force Terror to flee in fear? 
You have great tasks ahead of you, 
Ormus thinks.
 
  519 72
The Church of Light harbors the darkest 
shadow of all. Tread lightly.
 
  520 89
When speaking of the dead, it is best to 
remain cryptic.
 
  521 84
The Travincal can be breached by the 
loss of one's wits, not by the use of 
them.
 
  522 95
Alkor is able to explain things much 
more clearly than Ormus.
 
  523 58
For one who spends so much time away 
from home, Meshif has taken Kurast's 
corruption the hardest.
 
  524 91
Asheara is both proud and 
self-conscious of her womanhood.
 
  525 65
Deckard Cain... Ormus has no time for 
the last son of the Horadrim. Pride led 
that holy Order to failure.
 
  526 63
Hratli suspects that Ormus is a mage. 
He can suspect whatever he wants, 
Ormus will not show him the true 
magic.
 
  527 53
Back in Lut Gholein Meshif told me he 
had a fondness for jade figurines. On 
his trading voyages he collected an odd 
assortment of such small statues.
 
I would show him your figurine. 
 
  528 160
Only Deckard Cain can make sense of 
this.
 
  529 73
Praise you! That jade figurine will 
complete the set I was collecting.
 
Here! I've had this statuette of a golden 
bird for years, but I consider it a fair 
exchange.
 
  530 89
I'm having fun just watching you run 
from place to place searching for a 
Golden Bird. Some hero you are.
 
  531 47
I've read legends about a sage named 
Ku Y'leh, who studied the mysteries of 
life beyond death.
 
If I remember correctly, his ashes were 
ensconced within a golden statuette. It 
was a very strange tale.
 
  532 134
You will have to take Ku Y'leh's ashes to 
Alkor.
 
  533 96
Such a beautiful statuette... But, you'd 
think it would've been better cared for. 
There's a compartment here that's full 
o' dust.
 
  534 73
Ah, the Golden Bird of Ku Y'leh.  Thank 
you, my friend. 
 
Busy yourself while I experiment with 
the ashes within it. Then, return and 
see what I have made for you.
 
  535 51
Ku Y'leh, in searching for immortal 
youth, found only an early death. His 
apprentices, seeking to live forever, 
burned his body in order to derive 
benefit from his ashes.
 
  536 50
Ku Y'leh was a powerful sage who was 
rumored to have brewed a potion of 
immortality. In an ironic twist of fate, 
he was murdered before his potent 
elixir could take effect.
 
  537 78
Don't tell me you believe in all of that 
'life after death' nonsense. You should 
be more concerned with avoiding death 
than making plans for after it finds 
you.
 
  538 120
From the ashes of Ku Y'leh I have mixed 
for you a potion.
 
  539 94
Immortality is definitely not for me.
 
Can you imagine having to wake up 
every night just to piss for the next 
thousand years?
 
  540 63
So, Meshif had the Golden Bird all 
along. I wonder if he knows what he 
gave up for that jade figurine.
 
  541 54
Ormus remembers the tale of Ku Y'leh. 
That venerable sage forgot that there 
is no life beyond death. There is only 
life.
 
Once prolonged unnaturally, it can 
become a living hell.
 
  542 67
I must admit, your foolish quest made 
little sense to me. But now I see the 
value of your actions. I believe you do 
possess great wisdom.
 
  543 33
Never forget that your ultimate purpose 
here in Kurast is to destroy Mephisto. 
The ancient Horadrim imprisoned the 
Lord of Hatred inside the Guardian 
Tower that is located within the Temple 
City of Travincal.
 
Know this, friend. The only way to gain 
entry to Mephisto's prison is to destroy 
the artifact known as the Compelling 
Orb.
 
Mephisto used this device to control the 
Zakarum Priests and their followers. 
The Orb can only be destroyed with an 
ancient flail imbued with the spirit of 
the one incorruptible priest.
 
Soon after his imprisonment, Mephisto 
worked his evil corruption on the 
Zakarum priesthood. All were turned to 
his dark ways, save one - Khalim, the 
Que-Hegan of the High Council.
 
Mephisto directed the other Council 
priests to slay and dismember Khalim 
and then scatter his remains across 
the Kingdom. The Priest Sankekur 
succeeded Khalim as Que-Hegan, 
eventually becoming the embodiment of 
Mephisto here on the mortal plane.
 
The corrupted High Council fashioned 
an Orb to control the rest of the 
Zakarum faithful and used their powers 
to hide the lair of their master from 
mortals.
 
Your task is to collect the scattered 
relics of Khalim - his Heart, his Brain, 
and his Eye. Then, using the Horadric 
Cube, transmute Khalim's Flail with his 
relics.
 
Once this is accomplished, you must 
destroy the Compelling Orb with 
Khalim's Will to open the way into the 
corrupt sanctum of Mephisto.
 
  544 61
You have found Khalim's Heart, and it 
still bears the courage to face 
Mephisto!
 
Place it in the Horadric Cube along with 
Khalim's other relics - the Eye, the 
Brain, and the Flail.
 
  545 52
Ahh... Khalim's Eye! Only it can reveal 
the true path to Mephisto.
 
Place the Eye in the Horadric Cube 
along with Khalim's other relics - the 
Heart, the Brain, and the Flail.
 
  546 58
This is most fortunate! Khalim's Brain 
knows Mephisto's weakness.
 
Place it in the Horadric Cube along with 
Khalim's other relics - the Eye, the 
Heart, and the Flail.
 
  547 46
Once properly imbued, Khalim's Flail can 
destroy the Compelling Orb and reveal 
the way to Mephisto.
 
Place it into the Horadric Cube along 
with Khalim's relics - his Heart, his 
Brain, and his Eye. Then, transmute 
them to carry out Khalim's Will.
 
  548 54
Masterfully done, hero! You have 
crafted Khalim's Will. Employ it to 
destroy the Compelling Orb and open 
the way to Mephisto. 
 
May the true Light guide your way.
 
  549 56
It pains me to waste time with you, so 
I'll get right to the point.
 
There is a very special book which you 
must find for me. It was written long 
ago by a sage known as Lam Esen, who 
studied Skatsimi magic and the effects 
of the Prime Evils on the mortal world. 
The Black Book was lost when the 
Children of Zakarum took over this 
land.
 
Now, you must reclaim it without delay! 
Its knowledge may aid us in this dark 
time ahead.
 
  550 73
The Black Book contains powerful 
secrets of Skatsim, the Old Religion, 
long eclipsed by Zakarum.
 
I should warn you. The Black Book is 
much sought after by both good and 
evil. Be wary.
 
  551 62
The Children of Zakarum believe that 
the Black Book is filled with 
blasphemous heresy. In truth, the book 
may contain the secrets to our ultimate 
redemption.
 
  552 73
Oh. No one really believes that the Black 
Book exists. It's just a symbol of 
Zakarum's anti-Skatsim propaganda.
 
  553 102
Many things can be found in the city of 
Kurast. The book may be there.
 
  554 54
We have long sought the Black Book of 
Lam Esen. Rumors of its whereabouts 
spread as fast as jungle plagues. If you 
find it, take it to Alkor.
 
  555 72
The Black Book is a powerful source of 
information. The Zakarum will do 
everything in their power to stop you 
from obtaining it.
 
  556 81
I've heard of the Black Book. My Order's 
code is based on many of its passages. 
If you find it, I will be greatly 
impressed.
 
  557 104
Did I neglect to mention that the book 
contains useful information about the 
Prime Evils?
 
  558 55
Even if you find the sacred Book, you 
must still traverse the jungle of 
meaning within it. That journey could 
prove to be far more perilous.
 
  559 56
Kurast was once the greatest city in the 
world. Now it is hard to tell where the 
jungle stops and the city begins. The 
jungle grows rampant on the soil 
enriched by the blood of my fellow 
citizens.
 
  560 68
I believe I can trust you now.
 
When you first arrived, I suspected you 
a spy for the Zakarum, the false 
religion whose faithful are now under 
the sway of a mysterious power. 
They've made a mockery of the Old 
Religion of Skatsim.
 
  561 62
Not getting much help?
 
You know, people are like rugs. Hang 
them out a window and shake 'em a 
couple times. You'll be surprised how 
much dirt comes out.
 
  562 81
I heard that there are ruined temples in 
Kurast. Perhaps you will find the Black 
Book in one of them.
 
  563 105
I hope you find the Black Book soon. I 
could use something to read while I 
wait for my orders.
 
  564 83
You have found the Book! It should give 
all of us here some insight into the 
nature of the Prime Evils...
 
Ah, but as for you...
 
  565 70
Why is the Black Book of Lam Esen like 
a coffin? Simple. Each holds the shape 
of our future.
 
  566 75
Thank all that's holy. You've returned 
with the Black Book! Maybe now you 
can put an end to the Evil that has 
destroyed my homeland.
 
  567 135
The Iron Wolves are very impressed by 
your skills.
 
  568 74
We have the Book. Now we must see if 
we can bear its revelations.
 
  569 86
You have found a source of information 
powerful enough to turn the tide 
against the Zakarum.
 
  570 89
So, you've returned with the Book. You 
surprise me. You must be very 
resourceful.
 
  571 45
As I told you before, I placed an 
enchantment upon the dockside in 
order to keep the demons at bay. But 
lately, the enchantment seems to be 
weakening.
 
If memory serves me correctly, there is 
a holy Skatsimi blade that could 
revitalize the enchantment. The blade 
is called the Gidbinn.
 
Find it, and our sanctuary here will 
remain safe.
 
  572 66
Have you not heard of the Gidbinn? 
Well, allow me to reduce your 
ignorance on the subject.
 
The Gidbinn is an enchanted dagger - a 
religious artifact greatly valued by the 
Old Religion, Skatsim.
 
  573 64
Ormus is familiar with the Gidbinn. But 
how would a powerful Skatsimi artifact 
aid an unbeliever like you?
 
  574 66
The Gidbinn is one of the few remaining 
relics of Skatsim, the Old Religion. It is 
reputed to have great powers.
 
  575 107
The Gidbinn will reinforce the 
enchantments that protect the 
dockside from the evil that infests 
Kurast.
 
  576 54
As far as we know, the Gidbinn is in the 
possession of the Children of Light. 
They do not wish it to fall into the 
hands of those who can restore its 
powers.
 
You may not believe it, but Ormus is the 
one who can use the Gidbinn to protect 
us.
 
  577 55
I've done some research on the Taan 
mage-clan, and it seems that most of 
their magical studies were focused on 
Skatsimi rites.
 
If anyone is qualified to use the powers 
of the Gidbinn, it would be Ormus.
 
  578 73
Don't let the Gidbinn's size fool you. 
Though it is only a small dagger, it 
holds tremendous power when in the 
hands of a true Skatsimi mage.
 
  579 70
Legend has it that the Skatsimi priests 
placed great power within the small 
blade. Power enough to repel this 
terrible jungle-curse which encroaches 
on our sanctuary.
 
  580 83
If we are to have peace from the 
shadow, you must find the weapon 
which will destroy the Light.
 
  581 67
The jungle is like nothing you've ever 
seen before. Imagine Paradise 
festering like a wound... then bursting!
 
  582 145
I'm certain that the Gidbinn is very 
closely guarded.
 
  583 70
Once the Gidbinn is found, Ormus will 
use it to strengthen the protective 
barrier around the dockside.
 
  584 75
Since you haven't come across the 
Gidbinn yet, the dagger must be deeper 
in the jungle nearer Kurast.
 
  585 97
You'd best get back out there and find 
that blade. The jungle creeps further 
into this camp by the hour.
 
  586 77
Hah! You have stolen the fabled blade 
from right under Zakarum's nose! This 
is a great day, indeed!
 
  587 41
You have done well, noble hero. Ormus 
congratulates you. The old spirits of 
Skatsim will watch over you for 
returning their sacred blade.
 
Now, after all these years, Ormus will 
once again use his powers to protect 
the innocent from the shadow. The 
spell that protects the dockside shall 
now be reinforced.
 
  588 79
With any luck, the spirits of Skatsim will 
grant us revenge upon the powers that 
ravaged this land.
 
  589 99
Now that fewer of the Iron Wolves are 
needed to guard the dockside, some of 
them have volunteered to accompany 
you free of charge.
 
  590 80
The Gidbinn's magic can only be 
channeled through Ormus.
 
Take it to him. He has the necessary 
knowledge about the ancient Skatsimi 
magics.
 
  591 62
Who could have foreseen that the Old 
Religion would play such an effective 
role in our war against the Three? 
Again, your efforts amaze me, my 
friend.
 
  592 67
You are truly amazing, stranger. There 
are precious few items in the world 
that would tempt me to go up against 
the Children of Zakarum and their 
midget minions.
 
  593 101
This magic ring does me no good.
 
Here... Wear it proudly!
 
  594 36
You have done well, my friend. Your 
courage and valor are an inspiration to 
us all.
 
But now the time has come to face 
those responsible for the evil that has 
stifled our land. You must destroy the 
High Council of Zakarum!
 
Long ago, these elders were charged 
with the stewardship of Mephisto, the 
Lord of Hatred, who was imprisoned 
within the Guardian Tower.
 
Through the generations, these pious 
men slowly fell more and more under 
the sway of Mephisto's malevolent 
power and the Council became an evil 
mockery of its former glory. 
 
It is Mephisto's Hatred that has 
corrupted Zakarum and turned its 
devout followers into paranoid 
fanatics. That is why you must travel 
to the Temple City of Travincal and 
slay the Council.
 
Once they are gone, Mephisto's hold 
over this land and its people will be 
broken!
 
  595 84
The Black Book contains some vague 
prophecies regarding this undertaking. 
I'm not so sure it will turn out well for 
you.
 
  596 90
I am but a potion dealer and an avid 
reader of occult books. What do I know 
of the Travincal?
 
  597 54
You must know that the Guardian Tower 
in the Temple City was built by the 
Horadrim for one purpose - to hold 
Mephisto. Once the Council is dead, 
you may enter the Tower.
 
  598 54
You must know that the Guardian Tower 
in the Temple City was built by the 
Horadrim for one purpose -  to hold 
Mephisto. Once the Council is dead, 
you may enter the Tower.
 
  599 68
There is only one way to the Temple 
City. You will have to cross many rivers 
and streams, but you'll find it. A great 
tower stands at its center.
 
  600 113
It has been said that Ormus speaks 
most clearly when his ideas are utterly 
mad.
 
  601 89
The Children of Zakarum who guard the 
Tower square can be killed, but their 
numbers are vast. You must destroy 
their Council.
 
  602 105
There are many zealots among the 
followers of Zakarum. It will be difficult 
to get past them.
 
  603 104
Remember. You can always find 
sanctuary here with us.
 
  604 75
This has been a trying time for all of us, 
but I sense this nightmare is coming to 
an end.
 
  605 63
Ormus tells me that the Council is 
comprised of tremendously powerful 
priests. It will be difficult to best them.
 
  606 93
The Temple City is well guarded. You'd 
best keep your wits about you.
 
  607 100
You are incredibly brave to venture into 
the lion's den. I wish you luck.
 
  608 95
Beware the followers of Zakarum. Their 
fanaticism is their greatest weapon.
 
  609 111
Kill as many as you can. I have a 
morbid love of excess.
 
  610 91
If only we could have found the Black 
Book. I feel as though a malevolent 
hand has led us away from it.
 
  611 49
If you die on this quest, I will 
commemorate your sacrifice in an epic 
poem. You will not need a potion to 
achieve immortality. Ormus' words will 
do that.
 
  612 110
Within the Temple City is a courtyard. 
The Council resides there.
 
  613 107
I have heard rumors that the Prime 
Evils are here seeking their Brother.
 
  614 161
The Iron Wolves and I are at the ready 
to aid you.
 
  615 139
Things are getting wilder than Ladies 
Night at the Slippery Fist.
 
  616 65
The followers of Zakarum demand 
complete allegiance to their creed. 
They have slaughtered many of their 
own for minor grievances.
 
They will not hesitate to kill you.
 
  617 75
After having served Mephisto all these 
years, the Council must be twisted by 
hatred and evil.
 
  618 81
Sankekur may be using a Compelling 
Orb to control the minds of the 
Children of Zakarum.
 
  619 80
I respect your need to do this. Honor 
demands that you see this through. Yet 
your chances are so slim...
 
  620 80
I respect your need to do this. Honor 
demands that you see this through. Yet 
your chances are so slim...
 
  621 91
You've accomplished the impossible! By 
killing the Council, the curse of 
Zakarum will be lifted and our land will 
be free!
 
Oh. Thank you!
 
  622 40
Ormus is grateful to you, stranger. You 
have broken the long, dark reign of 
Zakarum and delivered the first 
paralyzing blow against the Three.
 
Yet still, the true test lies ahead. For he 
whom the Council guarded still lives 
within the Blackened Tower.
 
  623 76
It seems the jungle is already dying 
back. You've broken the curse, my 
friend! May the Light bless you!
 
  624 125
The sun has set on the Religion of Light.
 
  625 68
The followers of Zakarum lacked all 
sense of moderation. The collapse of 
their tainted religion gives me hope.
 
  626 48
Ridding Kurast of the Council of 
Zakarum was essential. Still, there is 
more you must do. The Compelling Orb, 
too, must be destroyed.
 
Diablo and Baal must be close to finding 
their brother, Mephisto, by now. You've 
no time to waste.
 
  627 88
I can hardly believe you did it. Your 
power blankets you like a shining aura.
 
  628 53
Diablo and Baal have surely found the 
Temple City by now. They seek to free 
their Brother, Mephisto, who was 
imprisoned by the Horadrim in the 
Temple's Guardian Tower.
 
You must reach him before his Brothers 
do and prevent them from releasing 
Hatred upon the world.
 
  629 90
The hidden ways of the Tower are long 
forgotten. Though... it is rumored to 
have been built as far below the 
ground as above it.
 
  630 114
We have seen Diablo, but remain unsure 
of his Brothers' whereabouts.
 
  631 52
Make haste! Though the Three are sure 
to reunite, it is uncertain as to what 
they have planned once they do.
 
Be cautious, my friend. Though you are 
mighty, no mortal can stand alone 
against the power of the Prime Evils.
 
  632 52
Make haste! Though the Three are sure 
to reunite, it is uncertain as to what 
they have planned once they do.
 
Be cautious, my friend. Though you are 
mighty, no mortal can stand alone 
against the power of the Prime Evils.
 
  633 66
Be careful when you return to the 
Tower. Though many of the followers 
of Zakarum have fled, there's no telling 
what horrors still lurk inside it.
 
  634 116
Move quickly, my friend, and end this 
curse once and for all!
 
  635 60
I sent a few of my Iron Wolves on a 
scouting mission into the jungle near 
the Temple City... They encountered 
two cloaked men who attacked them 
with horrifying powers.
 
My men barely survived. I have to 
assume that the two strangers are 
Diablo and Baal.
 
You'd better hurry. They're close to 
finding their brother.
 
  636 93
Many Iron Wolves have disappeared in 
Travincal. The Evil is still strong there.
 
  637 43
Mephisto, along with Baal, was 
originally captured in the desert near 
Lut Gholein. But imprisoning two of the 
Brothers together was far too 
dangerous.
 
The Horadrim built the Guardian Tower 
to hold Mephisto. When Zakarum came 
to power in this land, it took over the 
Temple City without paying any heed to 
what was locked within the Tower.
 
And it became their doom.
 
  638 73
I hear there is a little family reunion 
about to take place in Kurast. The 
Three brothers draw close.
 
  639 116
You must reach Mephisto before his 
brothers do.
 
  640 50
The ancient Horadrim always feared 
that the Three would escape their 
prisons and unite. I can't believe that I, 
the last of their Order, have seen it 
come to pass.
 
You are the only one who can prevent 
this, my friend. The final hour draws 
near.
 
  641 75
Now you rush to face Mephisto. Don't 
give in to your hatred. That is his 
greatest weapon against you.
 
  642 75
Now you rush to face Mephisto. Don't 
give in to your hatred. That is his 
greatest weapon against you.
 
  643 68
Well, the good news is that events are 
unfolding just as Lam Esen foretold. 
The bad news is that the story ends in 
our utter ruin!
 
  644 80
I'm afraid both fear and a large dose of 
elixir preclude me from answering.
 
  645 59
I understand that the great Patriarch of 
Zakarum, Sankekur, now embodies 
Mephisto.
 
You must overcome Hatred lest Terror 
and Destruction claim us all!
 
  646 77
I am loath to describe what will happen 
if Diablo and Baal release Mephisto.
 
  647 110
I ought to return to the ship. We may 
have to sail from here very quickly.
 
  648 110
I ought to return to the ship. We may 
have to sail from here very quickly.
 
  649 80
The sudden reduction in our ranks 
makes us eager to destroy Diablo and 
his brothers. Vengeance for the Iron 
Wolves!
 
  650 200
We will fight to the death.
 
  651 58
Why build a Tower to place the beast 
below ground? At times I believe the 
Horadrim lacked common sense.
 
  652 106
Shouldn't you be running frantically up 
and down stairs about now?
 
  653 96
Search the Tower thoroughly. Mephisto 
must not escape.
 
  654 96
Search the Tower thoroughly. Mephisto 
must not escape.
 
  655 55
Beware, my friend. Sankekur may be the 
most powerful mortal in the world. He 
controls thousands of fanatical 
worshippers and embodies the Lord of 
Hatred, himself. His death will be no 
easy task.
 
  656 55
Beware, my friend. Sankekur may be the 
most powerful mortal in the world. He 
controls thousands of fanatical 
worshippers and embodies the Lord of 
Hatred himself. His death will be no 
easy task.
 
  657 71
Your news is great indeed. You have 
saved us all. I would smile, but I'm 
afraid my face might collapse.
 
  658 48
You have defeated a Prime Evil in 
combat. Ormus is impressed beyond 
words. But staying here will not end 
this conflict.
 
You must enter the Infernal Gate and 
stop Diablo once and for all.
 
  659 70
Ahh... Now, Kurast can begin the task 
of rekindling its former glory... I thank 
you.
 
  660 65
Well done, my friend. You are a great 
champion of Order. Please, consider 
yourself an honorary Iron Wolf.
 
  661 121
It looks like you're going to Hell before 
me.
 
Put in a good word.
 
  662 42
Our faith in you was well deserved. But 
Diablo has made his way to Hell; and it 
is likely that Baal followed him there.
 
Enter the Infernal Gate and kill the Lord 
of Terror before all is lost. Only then 
will our world be saved!
 
  663 55
Word is spreading fast that you killed 
Mephisto. I'd be honored to fight 
beside you in Hell, but I've just received 
my mission orders.
 
I'll be travelling to the Barbarian lands 
of the North, but I can't tell you why. 
With luck, our paths will cross again. 
Farewell.
 
  664 43
It is good to see you again, hero.
 
Mephisto's defeat is a great victory for 
the Light. I knew that you would 
eventually find your way here. The 
Pandemonium Fortress is the last 
bastion of Heaven's power before the 
Gates of the Burning Hells.
 
This place has been hallowed by the 
blood of thousands of champions of 
the Light, many of whom were mortal, 
like yourself. Now the final battle 
against the Prime Evils draws near... 
and you must face it alone. 
 
I have been forbidden to aid you 
directly, save for a few bits of wisdom. 
For this is the hour of mortal Man's 
triumph...your triumph.
 
May the Light protect you and the 
powers of Heaven shine upon your 
path...
 
  665 62
Long ago, I swore an oath to watch 
over the Horadrim and their 
descendants.
 
As Deckard Cain is the last of their 
esteemed Order, I will not allow him to 
perish here so far from the lands of his 
birth.
 
Be at ease, hero, I know that he is your 
friend. He shall come to no harm.
 
  666 41
Can you believe this place? Did you ever 
dare to dream that you'd one day 
stand upon the crossroads between 
Heaven and Hell? This Pandemonium 
Fortress is truly miraculous.
 
However, your journey is not yet over. 
Diablo still roams free in Hell, 
marshalling his demonic forces. Only 
when he is beaten will our world finally 
have peace.
 
Hurry now... the sands of time slow for 
no one! 
 
  667 48
I have read much about the enigmatic 
Archangel Tyrael. He was revered in 
Horadrim lore both for his compassion 
for mortals and his unquenchable 
spirit.
 
It was rumored that he went against the 
wishes of Heaven and gave the 
Horadrim the original Soulstones in 
order to trap Diablo and his Brothers.
 
  668 72
Halt! Before venturing into Diablo's lair, 
go to the Hellforge with Mephisto's 
Soulstone.
 
Place the stone on the Hellforge and 
use the Hellforge Hammer to destroy 
it.
 
  669 66
Proceed, hero, into Terror's lair.
 
Know that Diablo's innermost sanctum 
is hidden by five seals.
 
Only by opening each of these seals can 
you clear your way to the final battle.
 
  670 42
There is a dark, tortured soul who was 
trapped within this forsaken realm long 
ago. He was called Izual by mortal 
men, and in ages past he was my most 
trusted Lieutenant.
 
Yet, against my wishes he led an 
ill-fated assault upon the fiery 
Hellforge, itself.
 
Despite his valor and strength, Izual 
was captured by the Prime Evils and 
twisted by their perverse power. They 
forced him to betray his own kind and 
give up Heaven's most guarded 
secrets.
 
He became a corrupt shadow of his 
former self - a fallen angel trusted 
neither by Heaven nor Hell.
 
For his transgressions, Izual's spirit 
was bound within the form of a terrible 
creature which was summoned from 
the Abyss. His maddened spirit has 
resided within that tortured husk for 
many ages now.
 
It seems to me that he has suffered 
long enough. I implore you, hero, find 
Izual and release him from his cruel 
imprisonment.
 
Put an end to his guilt and suffering.
 
  671 59
Though Izual no longer carries the 
Angelic Runeblade, Azurewrath, he may 
still possess great strength and power 
within his new form.
 
Also, he may not be able to tell friend 
from foe while in his present state. If 
you find him, he will almost certainly be 
hostile.
 
Proceed with the utmost caution.
 
  672 54
Tyrael has asked you to confront Izual 
the Fallen? He must have great faith in 
your abilities!
 
I trust you know what you're doing... Be 
careful. You're our last hope.
 
  673 75
You mustn't delay, mortal hero. Izual 
must be put to rest, but Diablo still 
lurks within this realm.
 
Go now... Hurry!
 
  674 83
Having trouble finding the Fallen Angel, 
eh?
 
You'd better hurry. It's beginning to feel 
like some great evil is permeating the 
air around here.
 
  675 47
Tyrael was a fool to have trusted me!
 
You see, it was I who told Diablo and his 
Brothers about the Soulstones and how 
to corrupt them. It was I who helped 
the Prime Evils mastermind their own 
exile to your world.
 
The plan we set in motion so long ago 
cannot be stopped by any mortal 
agency.  Hell, itself, is poised to spill 
forth into your world like a tidal wave 
of blood and nightmares.
 
You and all your kind... are doomed.
 
  676 53
Thank you, hero, for putting Izual's 
tortured spirit to rest. May the Light 
protect you and the powers of Heaven 
shine upon your path.
 
But, if what you tell me is true, then I 
fear that we have been played for fools 
all along.
 
Izual helped Diablo and his Brothers 
trick me into using the Soulstones 
against them... Now the Stones' powers 
are corrupted.
 
With the combined powers of the 
Soulstones under their control, the 
Prime Evils will be able to turn the 
mortal world into a permanent outpost 
of Hell!
 
  677 68
You're lucky to be alive, my friend! It is 
imperative that you find and stop 
Diablo!
 
You should speak of this with Tyrael. He 
will know what to make of this.
 
  678 53
The time has come for you to destroy 
Mephisto's Soulstone!
 
Take the Stone to the Hellforge. Place it 
upon the forge and strike it soundly 
with the Hammer.
 
Only by doing this can you prevent 
Mephisto from manifesting in this 
world ever again.
 
  679 50
The time has come to destroy 
Mephisto's Soulstone! 
 
Although I picked it up before entering 
the Infernal Gate, I believe you should 
carry out this crucial mission.
 
Take the Stone to the Hellforge.  Place 
it upon the forge and strike it soundly 
with the Hammer.
 
Only by doing this can you prevent 
Mephisto from manifesting in this 
world ever again.
 
  680 70
Congratulations, hero!
 
Surely, even Diablo, himself, sensed the 
fury unleashed when you smashed his 
Brother's Soulstone.
 
  681 48
The time has come to hunt down and 
destroy Diablo, himself.
 
But beware, the Lord of Terror is not to 
be underestimated. He single-handedly 
destroyed the town of Tristram and 
corrupted the last noble hero who tried 
to stop him.
 
This time, you must defeat him for 
good. Only by destroying the Soulstone 
which he carries will his spirit be 
banished forever.
 
Good luck! Though this be our darkest 
hour, it may yet be your greatest 
moment.
 
  682 54
You don't have time to dally about here!
 
Diablo awaits you in Hell. Remember... 
Diablo's greatest weapon against you is 
Terror.
 
Don't give in to your fears. Resist his 
power and put an end to him for good!

  684 62
Praise be to the Light! You have 
accomplished the impossible!
 
Diablo and Mephisto have been 
banished back into the Black Abyss 
that spawned them and the corrupted 
Soulstones are no more.
 
You've done well, hero. For now, you 
should rejoice.
 
  685 42
I knew there was great potential in you, 
my friend. You've done a fantastic job.
 
Though my ancestors often struggled 
against the Three Evils and their 
minions, I've always lived a shut-in, 
scholarly life. I'm glad that my wisdom 
aided you.
 
Now, I wish to leave this place. Though 
Heaven's Gates are a marvel to behold, 
I hope I won't have to see them again 
for many, many years.

 1074 Come on. 
 1075 This is for you. 
 1076 This is yours. 
 1077 Thank you. 
 1078 Thanks. 
 1079 Oops. 
 1080 Forgive me. 
 1081 Goodbye. 
 1082 Bye. 
 1083 Die! 
 1084 Time to Die! 
 1085 Not enough mana. 
 1086 I need mana. 
 1087 I can't use this yet. 
 1088 I am overburdened. 
 1089 I can't carry anymore. 
 1090 Not in Town. 
 1091 Not Here. 
 1092 I can't do that here. 
 1093 It's Locked. 
 1094 I need a key. 
 1095 I shall purge this land of the shadow. 
 1096 Beware foul demons and beasts. 
 1097 I will cleanse thiw widerness. 
 1098 Evil beware! 
 1099 My enemies beware. 
 1100 I hear foul creatures about. 
 1101 There are many foes here. 
 1102 Evil Dwells within this cave. 
 1103 This place is trouble. 
 1104 I sense death within this place. 
 1105 I sense great sorrow and misery. 
 1106 I shall meet death head-on. 
 1107 This holy place has been desecrated! 
 1108 There is dark magic at work here. 
 1109 Too many empty graves. 
 1110 So, this is the site of Andariel's atrocities. 
 1111 The Monastery reeks with evil and corruption. 
 1112 Even the Light cannot pierce this gloom. 
 1113 Ah, the Monastery... Andariel's stronghold! 
 1114 This place has the stench of demons about it. 
 1115 What's that smell? 
 1116 The stench of poison... 
 1117 This tower shall be cleansed of evil. 
 1118 This place holds many secrets. 
 1119 This place reeks of death. 
 1120 What nightmarish tortures took place here? 
 1121 No one should ever be caged. 
 1122 This is no place for a warrior to die. 
 1123 If there was magic here, it's long gone now. 
 1124 Ah, the slow torture of caged starvation. 
 1125 Removed 
 1126 Removed 
 1127 Removed 
 1128 Removed 
 1129 Removed 
 1130 This place is eerie. 
 1131 So cold and damp under the earth. 
 1132 There is great evil here. 
 1133 This place chills me to the bone. 
 1134 I sense a demonic presence here. 
 1135 Perhaps now the Sisters will trust me. 
 1136 The Rogues are safe for the moment. 
 1137 My duty here is done. 
 1138 This cave has been purged of evil. 
 1139 Is that enough to earn the Rogues' trust? 
 1140 Rest in peace, Sister. 
 1141 Good riddance, Blood Raven. 
 1142 Sisters, there was no other way. 
 1143 Rest now, Blood Raven. 
 1144 Blood Raven... rest well. 
 1145 What a strange-looking tree... 
 1146 This tree is one of a kind. 
 1147 This tree bristles with magic! 
 1148 This ancient tree has an aura of magic about it. 
 1149 This tree shines with inner spirits. 
 1150 These stones serve some magical purpose... 
 1151 These magic stones are ancient. 
 1152 Maybe Akara could dispel the mystery of these stones. 
 1153 These stones radiate powerful magic. 
 1154 I sense many spirits around the stones. 
 1155 It's as if a great war were fought here. 
 1156 The land here is dead and lifeless. 
 1157 What a tragic end to Tristram! 
 1158 Tristram was no match for Diablo's fury. 
 1159 All that's left of proud Tristram are ghosts and ashes. 
 1160 Deckard Cain, go to the Rogues' camp without delay! 
 1161 Deckard Cain, you've got to get out of here! 
 1162 Deckard Cain, leave quickly! 
 1163 Deckard Cain, get to the Rogue camp! 
 1164 Deckard Cain, if you value your life, leave here immediately. 
 1165 The Sisters will be glad to have this back! 
 1166 I should take this to Charsi. 
 1167 This will help the Sisters turn the tide against evil. 
 1168 I hope the Sisters appreciate this thing... 
 1169 All this for a hammer? 
 1170 The Tower's trove... for the taking! 
 1171 This is reward enough! 
 1172 I've earned the right to this abandoned trove. 
 1173 I hope to find other such treasures! 
 1174 Treasure hunting... bah... Treasure finding... yes. 
 1175 This Maiden shall inflict no more anguish. 
 1176 Let the gate be opened! 
 1177 My work here is finished. 
 1178 The evil queen has fallen. 
 1179 Back to the hell that spawned you, Andariel. 
 1180 This place disgusts me. 
 1181 Ugh... The tell-tale stench of a carnivore's lair. 
 1182 The foul stench of evil assails me. 
 1183 I sense strange magic here. 
 1184 I sense a powerful undead being within this place. 
 1185 Atma has been avenged. 
 1186 I've just about had my fill of the walking dead. 
 1187 I pray that Atma will rest easy now. 
 1188 What a misguided monster. 
 1189 What a waste of undead flesh. 
 1190 Great. An eclipse. This just keeps getting better and better. 
 1191 What is wrong with the sun? 
 1192 What Evil taints the light of the sun? 
 1193 Only powerful magic can conjure an eclipse. 
 1194 Only the darkest magics can turn the sun black. 
 1195 I hope I know what I'm doing! 
 1196 The sun has never shone here! 
 1197 Light guide my way in this accursed place. 
 1198 I sense strong magic within this place. 
 1199 This place is as dark as a tomb. 
 1200 Let there be light. 
 1201 It is good to know that the sun shines once again. 
 1202 The Light can never be extinguished by evil. 
 1203 Who would have thought that such primitive beings could cause so much trouble! 
 1204 What a pity. I was beginning to enjoy the darkness. 
 1205 Am I the first to find this Arcane fortress? 
 1206 One could get lost in here. 
 1207 This surely is the product of a twisted mind! 
 1208 This place actually... distorts reality. Fascinating. 
 1209 This is fantastic! I wish I had time to study this bizarre dimension. 
 1210 What a freak! 
 1211 Stand aside, old fool. I have no time for your babblings. 
 1212 Surely the evil here has driven you mad. 
 1213 Is this truly Horazon? 
 1214 This bumbling fool cannot be the mighty Horazon! 
 1215 Good riddance, freak. 
 1216 I hate staining my hands with the blood of foul sorcerers. 
 1217 Rest in peace, tortured soul. 
 1218 That couldn't have been Horazon. Poor wretch. 
 1219 He was not Horazon. He was a deluded fool who got too close to true power! 
 1220 This has got to be the right place. 
 1221 This tomb is very ornate. This must be Tal Rasha's resting place. 
 1222 Is this the tomb I seek? 
 1223 This tomb has Horadric markings. I wonder if this is Tal Rasha's tomb? 
 1224 This could be Tal Rasha's tomb. However, I'm sensing very strange energies here. 
 1225 Should I enter...?  Diablo and Baal may have laid a trap... 
 1226 Such a cold breeze... Tal Rasha must be kept here. 
 1227 Here, at last, is a fitting testament in stone to Tal Rasha's sacrifice. 
 1228 This must be the true Tomb of Tal Rasha! 
 1229 I sense an incredible aura about this tomb. The Horadrim hid something powerful inside. 
 1230 This is not good. Will this madness ever end? 
 1231 I have failed. Diablo has freed his accursed brother. The world remains at their mercy. 
 1232 I shall honor Tal Rasha's sacrifice by destroying all the Prime Evils. 
 1233 Diablo and Baal have escaped me!  Next time... vengeance! 
 1234 I came too late. Now... Destruction is let loose upon the world once more. 
 1235 Not in Game 
 1236 I hope the secrets within this book can help us. 
 1237 I hope this book is worth all the trouble. 
 1238 The Black Book... It's heresy to the Zakarum High Council. 
 1239 This tome has the weight of knowledge about it. 
 1240 This ancient book radiates arcane power! 
 1241 All this trouble over a tattered book. 
 1242 May this book lift the shadow from Kurast. 
 1243 May the Black Book deliver us from evil! 
 1244 May the Black Book bring a black day to hell! 
 1245 Once the book has served its purpose, I shall delve into its secrets. 
 1246 Whoa.... What died down here? 
 1247 Cough... The stench down here is choking! 
 1248 The smell of death... or worse... surrounds me. 
 1249 It smells worse than rotting reagents down here. 
 1250 It's been years since I waded through sewers for fun. 
 1251 I hope this does something good... 
 1252 This will drain out some of the filth. 
 1253 This appears to control the ancient valves. 
 1254 This looks promising. 
 1255 This looks like what I've been searching for. 
 1256 Eureka! 
 1257 Good. Now I can get out of here and get some fresh air! 
 1258 This trove will help lift the curse from Kurast! 
 1259 I hope these items can aid me against the demons. 
 1260 Great. More junk. Just what I'd expect to find in a sewer... 
 1261 This dagger will separate the faithful from the fallen. 
 1262 This holy blade does not belong in the hands of the Zakarum. 
 1263 This blade shall pierce the heart of evil! 
 1264 I must take this to Ormus. 
 1265 This is a powerful weapon. Perhaps Ormus can tell me more about it. 
 1266 What would this bring from the right buyer? 
 1267 What a strange little statue. 
 1268 Perhaps I could trade this for something more valuable? 
 1269 I don't sense any magic about this item. Very strange. 
 1270 A worthless statue. Perhaps I can trade this for something better. 
 1271 Such a dark temple for a Religion of Light... 
 1272 The spirits of nature have fled this dreaded place. 
 1273 This corrupted temple was once the shining heart of my religion... 
 1274 I sense tremendous evil within this place. 
 1275 This temple exudes darkness. 
 1276 Skatsim's reign is renewed! 
 1277 The dark powers here will no longer poison the land. 
 1278 The Temple shall shine anew with the Light. 
 1279 The Temple's power is annulled. 
 1280 The Temple's dark power is broken. 
 1281 This must be where Mephisto is. 
 1282 The final resting place of Hatred itself. 
 1283 This must be where the Horadrim imprisoned Mephisto. 
 1284 Ah... Mephisto's prison. 
 1285 The Tower that holds Mephisto.... 
 1286 Success... But still there's something not right. 
 1287 Maybe now the world will have peace. 
 1288 The Lord of Hatred shall darken the world no longer. 
 1289 Mephisto shall no longer darken our souls with hatred. 
 1290 Good journey, Mephisto. Give my regards to the abyss. 
 1291 Wait... Don't I get three wishes? 
 1292 Even Fallen Angels deserve freedom. 
 1293 How can one who was once so holy fall so far from righteousness? 
 1294 He was corrupted to the core. I pity him. 
 1295 Bah! Izual was weak. He squandered his infernal power.
