Praise be to the Light! You have 
accomplished the impossible!
 
Diablo and Mephisto have been 
banished back into the Black Abyss 
that spawned them, and the corrupted 
Soulstones are no more.
 
However, while you were fighting here, 
Baal remained behind in the mortal 
realm, building an army of hellish 
minions. Now, Baal's army is searching 
for the Worldstone, the ancient source 
of all the Soulstones and their power, 
while leaving behind a wake of 
destruction. They have forged deeply 
into the Barbarian homelands, heading 
directly for the summit of Mount 
Arreat!
 
Baal knows, mortal hero! That is the 
very site of the blessed Worldstone!
 
Now, enter the portal I have opened for 
you. It will take you to the Barbarian 
city of Harrogath, the last bastion of 
Order on the slopes of Arreat.
 
    1 40
I knew there was great potential in you, 
my friend. You've done a fantastic job.
 
Though my ancestors often struggled 
against the Three Evils and their 
minions, I've always lived a shut-in, 
scholarly life. I'm glad that my wisdom 
aided you.
 
Now, I wish to leave this place. Though 
Heaven's Gates are a marvel to behold, 
I hope I won't have to see them again 
for many, many years.
 
Please talk to Tyrael about leaving this 
place now!
 
    2 35
We are the spirits of the Nephalem, the 
Ancient Ones. We have been chosen to 
guard sacred Mount Arreat, wherein 
the Worldstone rests. Few are worthy 
to stand in its presence; fewer still can 
comprehend its true purpose.
 
Before you enter, you must defeat us.
 
    3 39
I am amazed to find this place so 
untouched. Everything else in the path 
of Baal the Lord of Destruction lies in 
ruin. 
 
These Barbarians must indeed be the 
legendary guardians of Mount Arreat. 
They are a proud, hardy people. Don't 
expect to be greeted warmly -- 
strangers here rarely are.
 
Perhaps I can gain their trust. I'll spend 
some time with the townsfolk and try 
to understand them better. I'll let you 
know what I discover.
 
    4 52
With hellspawn, size is no measure of 
their threat. Demons half the size of 
men can kill with a gesture, while 
hellish pack animals trample any who 
stand in their way.
 
    5 55
Though these Barbarians are known 
throughout the kingdoms as ferocious 
fighters, they are also capable of great 
compassion.
 
They have trained throughout history 
for a battle their legends foretell will 
decide the fate of the world.
 
    6 55
The angel Tyrael has watched over the 
guardians of Arreat throughout 
history. I do not believe that Baal and 
Tyrael have come to fight over a paltry 
few souls.
 
They are here to settle a conflict as old 
as time itself.
 
    7 44
During my time with the Horadrim, we 
often debated the nature of Mount 
Arreat.
 
We knew that the Barbarian clans 
zealously guarded the mountain as 
their sacred duty. However, many 
dismissed their zeal as simple 
superstition...combined with an inborn 
hostility toward outsiders.
 
Those Horadrim who trekked up Arreat 
were never heard from again...Still, I 
do not believe they died at the hands of 
Barbarians.
 
    8 41
All users of the magical arts know of 
Mount Arreat, but few understand its 
true nature. It is the nexus of an 
unfathomable magic.
 
It bodes ill that the Lord of Destruction 
races to its summit with such purpose. 
I fear for the whole world should Baal 
gain what he seeks.
 
    9 59
I have spent decades trying to 
understand the forces at work in this 
world. But in the face of all that is 
transpiring, I realize how meager my 
knowledge is.
 
I will be of assistance where I can, my 
friend.
 
   10 54
Though the Elder Council of Harrogath 
is gone, there are many capable young 
leaders to take their place.
 
Anya certainly has enough courage and 
intelligence to lead them all, if they can 
survive this catastrophe.
 
   11 53
Ah, Anya. Such a fine example of 
feminine strength...
 
She reminds me of the Zakarum 
priestesses I knew in my youth. They 
don't take vows of chastity, you know.
 
   12 65
It is fortunate that this town has such a 
talented smith.
 
The quality of Larzuk's work surely 
complements your skills. In fact, he 
would have been quite welcome 
amongst the Horadrim.
 
   13 54
It is my belief that the Soulstones are at 
the center of this conflict. If only that 
fool Marius had not intervened, Baal 
would still be imprisoned within Tal 
Rasha.
 
   14 54
You have proven yourself a true hero to 
me and my people.
 
These are dark times, warrior. I hope 
you can bring an end to Baal's reign of 
destruction. 
 
Our Council of Elders is gone -- my 
father, Aust, among them. The one 
thing that keeps us from total despair 
is the promise of vengeance against 
Baal.
 
   15 45
Now that the Elders are all dead, I don't 
know who will guide our people through 
this dark time. I was to be next in line 
after my father, but this burden is too 
great for me to shoulder alone. 
 
We are a people of strong blood. I shall 
do what I can and let fate do the rest.
 
   16 82
Baal's minions are not to be trifled with. 
In their bloodlust they will sacrifice 
themselves to destroy you.
 
   17 60
Many outsiders believe that the 
fantastic stories about our ancestors, 
the Ancients, are but fables. However, I 
believe that the Ancients were more 
than human -- that mankind has fallen 
from what it once was.
 
   18 58
When I was a child, the Elders told us 
stories about the mountain and its 
power...and how the Barbarian people 
are bound to it as protectors.
 
Baal is not just taking our land -- with 
every step he takes up the mountain, 
he takes a part of who we are as a 
people.
 
   19 72
I am truly glad you are here, warrior. 
Perhaps things would be different now 
if we had asked for assistance from 
the neighboring kingdoms.
 
Our foolish, foolish pride...
 
   20 54
My father, Aust, was among those 
Elders wise enough to see that we 
would need outside help to deal with 
Baal's legions. He believed that this 
conflict would affect the entire world, 
not just our homeland. He said that 
Mount Arreat is as necessary to the 
world's survival as food and water is to 
our own.
 
I believe this to be true.
 
   21 50
Qual-Kehk's confidence in his abilities 
once bordered on arrogance, but in the 
early days of the siege, he was 
humbled by Baal. While he saved us 
from immediate destruction, a third of 
our warriors were lost.
 
None felt those losses more than he. 
Though he may not admit it, your 
presence gives him hope, warrior.
 
   22 78
If Larzuk could sing or dance half as 
well as he smiths, he'd be married by 
now.
 
...Just look at those shoulders.
 
   23 57
Nihlathak was the last of our Elders, 
whose charge it was to safeguard the 
mountain. He alone tried to guide us 
through the most desperate time in our 
history -- but he was just as helpless as 
the rest of us.
 
I cannot forgive his betrayal, but I can 
learn from it.
 
   24 60
Our people believe that the Ancients 
protecting Mount Arreat have the 
power to stop Baal. Unfortunately, the 
Lord of Destruction has shown great 
power to undermine our faith.
 
   25 55
I am Larzuk, the armorer. My ancestors 
were some of the finest craftsmen in 
Harrogath. 
 
Regretfully, my supplies run lower with 
every passing day, yet the demons 
beyond the walls have not weakened. 
 
I fear the time is near when I must put 
down my hammer and take up a sword, 
instead.
 
   26 42
So, you're an Amazon. I have heard 
rumors about your kind. Your unusual 
weapons could prove a challenge to my 
skills, but I'm prepared to meet it.

   27 65
I've heard that you Amazons excel at 
killing from a distance. From what I've 
seen, that's the best way to deal with 
Hell's minions. 
 
Are all of your kind so...big?
 
   28 65
Why did you ever leave your beautiful 
islands to come to this frozen 
battleground? Perhaps if we both 
survive this, we'll travel back there 
together.
 
   29 75
Has that infernal howling been keeping 
you awake at night, too? Some think 
it's the howling of animals, but those 
sounds don't come from any beast I've 
ever known.
 
   30 69
Demonic forces have been using our 
own towers and barricades against us. 
You know, it would be wise to cut the 
demons down in the open before they 
can mount those fortifications.
 
   31 70
Nihlathak's despair is infectious -- and 
his behavior does not befit an Elder of 
his stature. I think we'd be better off 
without him.
 
   32 63
I've offered Qual-Kehk my ideas on how 
to break the siege, but he dismisses 
them. Is it because I lack scars of 
battle, or does he think I'm a couple 
arrows short of a quiver?
 
   33 64
Legend has it that the top of Mount 
Arreat is guarded by the spirits of our 
ancestors. Though our people are 
forbidden to climb to the mountain's 
summit, some foreign travelers have 
made the attempt.
 
None have ever returned.
 
   34 66
This is a lively town during our victory 
celebrations. We Barbarians train long 
and hard from childhood to become 
warriors, and we celebrate with equal 
fervor.
 
You didn't happen to bring along any 
ale to trade?
 
   35 54
Every day, one of my friends dies 
fighting outside the town walls, while I 
tend my anvil here unscathed. If only 
we didn't need weapons so badly, I 
could be out doing my share of the 
fighting. 
 
Good luck to you, warrior.
 
   36 56
Just so you know...The gold you pay me 
doesn't line my pockets. Much of it 
goes to buy the raw metal I need to 
melt down for weapons and armor. The 
rest -- well, all I can spare -- goes to 
Malah and Qual-Kehk for other 
supplies.
 
   37 35
I, Malah, welcome you to Harrogath, 
the last stronghold of Order on Mount 
Arreat. You have come to the right 
place if you intend to defeat Baal the 
Lord of Destruction.
 
Baal has laid waste to our mountain 
and its denizens. His minions continue 
to attack our town, while Qual-Kehk 
and his men have proven helpless to 
stop them. Baal is still out on the 
mountain looking for something -- but I 
know not what. 
 
All of the Elders, save Nihlathak, 
sacrificed themselves to place a 
protective ward around Harrogath.
 
Some of us here, certainly Nihlathak, do 
not appreciate your presence. We are a 
proud people, and it is not easy for us 
to accept aid. I, however, am glad you 
are here.
 
If you need healing or a potion, please 
come to me. See Larzuk for weapons, 
armor, and repairs. Nihlathak, despite 
his disposition, may be of some 
assistance with other wares. Finally, 
Qual-Kehk, our Man-At-Arms, leads 
Harrogath's remaining forces against 
Baal.
 
   38 36
A Sorceress...Here in Harrogath?
 
There was a time, child, when I thought 
I was destined to follow your kind's 
path. However, my powers never 
developed beyond the simplest of 
spells. Although I can heal almost any 
wound with time and energy, there is 
little I can do to help against Baal.
 
But enough of that...I spend too much 
time in reflection and have forgotten 
my manners.
 
I, Malah, welcome you to Harrogath, 
the last stronghold of Order on Mount 
Arreat. You have come to the right 
place, if you intend to defeat Baal the 
Lord of Destruction.

   39 34
You have traveled far only to return 
home to us, Barbarian. Ohh...Much has 
happened in Harrogath since you left. 
Our homeland is hardly recognizable 
with so much evil about.
 
Yet, I've managed to survive so far. 
You've seen your share of suffering as 
well, I'm sure. Seeing you again -- alive 
-- does my heart good. I shall pray that 
you can help us out of this hell.

and its denizens. His minions continue 
to attack our town, while Qual-Kehk 
and his men have proven helpless to

mountain looking for something -- but I

Nihlathak is the last survivor of the 
Council of Elders, but I'm afraid he has 
not been himself lately. The other 
Elders sacrificed themselves to place a 
protective ward around Harrogath. If 
Nihlathak is curt with you, it is because 
he feels responsible for our situation. 
He does not relish sending more of our 
people out to die.
 
So much has changed since you left 
that I see little hope for us in this life.
 
If you need healing or a potion, please 
come to me. See Larzuk for weapons, 
armor, and repairs. Nihlathak, despite 
his disposition, may be of some 
assistance with other wares. Finally, 
Qual-Kehk, our Man-At-Arms, leads 
Harrogath's remaining forces against 
Baal.
 
   40 53
I'm aware of the amazing magical 
powers a Sorceress can channel. If we 
survive Baal's wrath, I would be most 
honored if you could demonstrate and 
perhaps teach me something of what 
you know. 
 
I may be old, but I'm not dead.
 
   41 42
I know you and my son, Bannuk, did not 
part on the best of terms. He did not 
understand the wanderlust that drove 
you to leave your homeland. However, 
even though Bannuk could never admit 
it to me, as he grew older I could see 
that same desire in his eyes.
 
Oh...It's a pity I didn't encourage him to 
go with you. He might still be alive 
today.
 
   42 57
Though once considered shelter by our 
people, the Ice Caves offer no refuge 
from the dark horde. There are 
creatures there that will freeze your 
heart before feasting upon it.
 
   43 107
On the battlefield, turning your back on 
even the dead is unwise.
 
   44 60
This battle plays mind tricks on our 
warriors. Those fortunate enough to 
have returned from the mountainside 
claim to have seen angels in flight.
 
Fly they might, but that certainly does 
not make them angels.
 
   45 53
Perhaps you have heard the accounts 
of my son's horrible death at the hands 
of Baal's minions. He was my last living 
child...
 
The oath of compassion I have taken as 
a healer extends only to humankind.
 
Cut them down, warrior. All of them!
 
   46 78
The catapults are infernal machines 
made of demon flesh fused with steel.
 
Be wary of them.
 
   47 60
Qual-Kehk is a worthy leader, but the 
losses have borne heavily upon him. He 
is only impatient because he judges the 
worth of a warrior by action, not 
words.
 
You must prove yourself worthy of his 
trust.
 
   48 52
Larzuk possesses a good soul, but at 
times his mind seems quite unsound. 
 
He once asked me for twenty of my 
finest sheepskins. He said he would fill 
them with hot air and float like a cloud 
above the battlefield to spy on Baal's 
legions! 
 
I worry the siege has driven him mad.
 
   49 90
Be cautious, warrior.
 
Though I am an experienced healer, 
resurrection is beyond my powers.
 
   50 53
I pray for the day when the fields are 
covered in snow unstained by the blood 
of our own. Perhaps that day will come 
soon...Perhaps never...
 
Oh...But I forget myself. How may I aid 
your quest?
 
   51 64
Your gold is most helpful. Medical 
supplies for our wounded are scarce 
and very expensive.
 
When we can find a supplier, oh, we 
must pay dearly for what we need.
 
   52 44
With the exception of Qual-Kehk, the 
townspeople do not see what I see -- 
the massacre we face.
 
Our bravest, strongest heroes hobble 
back to me begging for help. I do what 
I can -- healing and bandaging some, 
preparing the others for what lies 
beyond.
 
   53 43
Well, well. The siege has everything in 
short supply...except fools. 
 
Why would you seek this place, 
stranger? Are you a vulture come to 
loot the bodies of our fallen warriors? 
 
Regardless, this is no place to make a 
name for yourself. The mountain is 
ours to protect. It is only a matter of 
time before Hell's legions are routed.
 
   54 54
Well, well...An Assassin!
 
Heh, heh...While I am sure we are all 
grateful for your presence in our 
troubled town, you need not have made 
the journey.
 
I can personally say that your skills are 
not required here. You would serve 
your clan better elsewhere.
 
   55 45
Ahhh, a Necromancer.
 
While I admire your courage in seeking 
out the darker side of magic, we really 
have little need of your skills. The 
battle will turn soon enough without 
your meddling. 
 
Yet, I should have expected to see your 
kind here. You are like a moth to the 
flame -- drawn to all this death. It 
feeds you in more ways than one, does 
it not?
 
   56 49
If you're looking for cases of 
treacherous magic, Assassin, take a 
hard look at Larzuk. He was the only 
one in town who escaped the Red Fever 
last spring. He claimed his good 
fortune was due to 'hand washing' 
before meals.
 
Hmmm...Very suspicious...
 
   57 48
Why would you seek this place, 
stranger? Are you a vulture come to 
loot the bodies of our fallen warriors? 
 
Regardless, this is no place to make a 
name for yourself. The mountain is 
ours to protect. It is only a matter of 
time before Hell's legions are routed.
 
   58 67
Qual-Kehk is useless. He has blindly 
sent our warriors to their deaths, 
assuming Baal's legions would fight as 
men do. Of course, everyone knows 
they do not.
 
   59 57
The demon hordes have grown powerful 
beyond measure, aided by our foolish 
mistakes. But I may have found a way 
to correct those mistakes...
 
   60 37
Oh yes...I remember our warriors as 
children. Malah would set their broken 
bones and give them powders for their 
fevers. Now, they return to her with 
wounds that will never heal.
 
I am tired...Please...leave me.
 
   61 133
If you have nothing useful for me, be on 
your way!
 
   62 81
Anya's father was my good friend. 
There are so many to mourn...I have 
no time for you!
 
   63 53
I have long been criticized, but 
especially of late -- since the deaths of 
my fellow Elders. Through it all, I have 
learned one thing. Each man must do 
what's right, no matter what others 
may think.
 
   64 65
The Council of Elders always believed 
itself prepared for the coming of the 
Three. Obviously, we were not prepared 
enough.
 
   65 45
I am Qual-Kehk, the Senior Man-At-Arms 
of Harrogath.
 
You have the look of a warrior...An 
extra soldier will be useful. But don't 
expect anyone to mourn if you get 
yourself killed. 
 
Baal is true to his namesake. He has 
ravaged through our lands like a 
merciless plague.
 
The protective ward laid down by our 
lost Elders helps hold the evil at bay, 
but Baal's siege has taken its toll all 
the same.
 
Most of my men are now dead. Others 
are trapped in the mountain passes.
 
But I swear we are not beaten yet! We 
will fight to the end to protect this 
mountain!
 
   66 42
A Paladin! I have long heard of your 
people.
 
As a young warrior I even considered 
the pilgrimage to Kurast. But I was 
younger then and foolish. My place has 
always been here -- protecting 
Harrogath, and Mount Arreat with it.
 
I am Qual-Kehk, the Senior Man-At-Arms 
of Harrogath.

   67 42
A Druid in Harrogath! Have things truly 
come to this?
 
After the Mage Wars, I assumed Druids 
would never be seen in Harrogath 
again. You take a big chance coming 
here! 
 
To be honest, I have never been 
comfortable with your shape-shifting 
kind, but I do respect your search for 
balance and peace. So, if you trust us 
enough to enter our gates, I trust you 
enough to let you stay.
 
I am Qual-Kehk, the Senior Man-At-Arms 
of Harrogath.

   68 67
It would be an honor to have a warrior 
of the Light fighting side-by-side with 
my men.
 
I can see your faith gives you great 
strength, Paladin, but don't expect it to 
keep you out of harm's way.
 
   69 61
Harrogath has great need of your 
powers, noble Druid. However, in the 
face of this supernatural onslaught, 
are your natural powers up to the 
task?
 
   70 44
The death of Malah's son was a great 
tragedy. He was our finest archer.
 
While leading a successful campaign 
against Baal's forces, he was impaled 
on a demon's spear. The wound was 
such that...Well, even Malah herself 
acknowledges that quick death was a 
blessing.
 
   71 57
We have lost many well-trained warriors 
to Baal's siege machines. Their range is 
great. Though, they are vulnerable if 
you close the distance quickly enough.
 
   72 96
Baal's legions seem countless, but 
slaying their commanders takes some 
of the fight out of them.
 
   73 58
Early on, parties of our best scouts 
were ambushed by demons that 
spawned from the very air around 
them. Survivors often mentioned a 
strange creature floating in the 
distance.
 
Perhaps taking it down could prevent 
some nasty surprises.
 
   74 57
This is unlike any battle I have ever 
fought. While we ration food and 
water, the demon hordes feast nightly 
on the flesh and blood of our dead.
 
   75 48
Larzuk is a talented blacksmith, but his 
head is full of some strange ideas. 
 
Just the other day he came to me with a 
plan to break the siege. He wanted to 
fill large pipes with exploding powders 
and steel balls, then...Well, like I said, 
strange.
 
   76 46
Our Elders were wise leaders in more 
peaceful times, but now the survival of 
our people has fallen to me. My men 
and I will fight to the death, but there's 
no way to ensure the outcome.
 
I used to believe that nothing could 
break through our guard and assault 
the holy mountain. I know now that I 
was horribly mistaken.
 
   77 45
If you're here to defeat Baal, you must 
prove it!
 
As we speak, Harrogath is under siege 
by Baal's demons. Catapults rain death 
just outside the town walls.
 
Baal himself travels up the sacred 
mountain, having left in charge here 
one of his most vicious generals, Shenk 
the Overseer. A ruthless taskmaster, 
he lashes his own minions into suicidal 
frenzies on the battlefield.
 
If you wish to prove yourself to us, 
destroy the monster, Shenk, that 
commands those infernal catapults 
outside Harrogath.  If you manage to 
do this, return to me.
 
   78 150
Uh...Did I mention there were catapults?
 
   79 83
I believe that stopping the siege on 
Harrogath is the only way for you to 
earn the trust of these people.
 
   80 84
You've proven your skill at rescuing fair 
maidens...but how are you at killing 
vicious beasts?
 
   81 77
Qual-Kehk and his men have been 
fighting to break the siege for some 
time. Where many have failed, you may 
succeed.
 
   82 70
After so many have died, who are you 
to think you can accomplish what our 
proud warriors could not?
 
   83 66
About to face Shenk the Overseer and 
stop the siege, are you? You should 
ask Malah to perform your last rites 
before you go, stranger.
 
   84 90
What's the matter, hero? Questioning 
your fortitude? I know we are.
 
   85 105
I understand your reluctance, but now 
is the time to strike.
 
   86 66
Those demons have been out there 
since before your arrival. Can you do 
nothing to stop them?
 
Your task is a simple one, warrior. Find 
Shenk and destroy him.
 
   87 64
This may not be very encouraging, but 
you have fared better than the others 
who passed through those gates.
 
In regards to Shenk the Overseer, 
remember: a general is nothing without 
his men.
 
   88 78
What are you still doing here? I thought 
you were going off to die.
 
Go...Be quick about it.
 
   89 93
So, you still live. You're either quick or a 
coward.
 
   90 63
You're an even greater warrior than I 
expected...Sorry for underestimating 
you.
 
As a token of my appreciation, I will 
craft sockets into an item of your 
choosing, and from now on, you'll get 
the best price for all my wares.
 
   91 60
Those catapults were like nothing I have 
ever seen before. You have prevailed 
against Shenk, my friend, but Baal is 
still far ahead of you.
 
   92 108
I was starting to wonder how long it 
would take you to stop those beasts.
 
Good job.
 
   93 94
Oh...At last, the siege is ended. You 
truly are an angel.
 
I thank you.
 
   94 65
Ending the siege does not earn 
immediate respect, outsider.
 
Respect only comes with sacrifice -- 
something I'm sure you know nothing 
of.
 
   95 68
So...You managed to stop the siege.
 
You are more powerful than I gave you 
credit for. You have rightfully earned 
my respect.
 
   96 58
My concerns have turned to my men 
taken prisoner on the battlefield by 
Baal's demons. I hate to think what's 
happened to them.
 
As you journey up the mountain, keep 
your eyes open for my soldiers and 
bring them back to me if you can.
 
   97 85
Those of my men fortunate enough to 
escape on their own told me that they 
were held captive in the highlands and 
plateaus.
 
   98 74
I know firsthand that captivity is a sad 
fate for a man. Find them quickly.
 
   99 85
If those men are being treated like I 
was, you must find them. They won't 
survive much longer.
 
  100 73
I crafted the swords and armor for 
Qual-Kehk's men. They were like 
brothers to me. I can't imagine the pain 
they must be suffering.
 
Save them if you can!
 
  101 84
Qual-Kehk's men have been imprisoned 
for some time. They are certain to be 
tired and weak.
 
You must protect them once you free 
them.
 
  102 94
You have proven you can take life, 
warrior, but can you save it as well?
 
  103 95
They say that discretion, not 
procrastination, is the better part of 
valor.
 
  104 78
More of my men are still alive out there. 
I am certain of it!
 
Find them. Free them from their cages 
and bring them back to me.
 
  105 63
If you are having trouble finding 
Qual-Kehk's soldiers, you should talk to 
Malah. She healed those who made it 
back before. Perhaps she would have 
some advice.
 
  106 115
Well, you found me on the mountain; I'm 
sure you'll find them too.
 
  107 76
As a kid, I used to play soldier among 
the barricades on the mountain. 
There's no easy way through that maze 
of walls.
 
  108 67
Soldiers who made it back told of a 
system of barricades placed among the 
mountain passes. They said that is 
where the prisoners are held.
 
  109 52
Did you ever stop to think why these 
demons are capturing Qual-Kehk's 
men? Why they are attacking us? Have 
you considered what Baal wants with 
the mountain?
 
No. You've not. You have no idea what 
you are dealing with.
 
  110 51
Thank you for rescuing my men. They 
have spoken well of your bravery in 
battle. Perhaps there is hope for us 
after all. 
 
If you wish, you may hire some of my 
mercenaries that you saved. And 
please...take this set of runes. I had 
been saving them for a socketed shield, 
but I think you'll make better use of 
them.
 
Be sure to set them in the right order 
for their fullest effect.
 
  111 80
You've become a hero to this town, my 
friend. The shadows have lifted ever 
since you brought the Light to 
Harrogath.
 
  112 107
I'm sure those men appreciate the 
freedom you gave them...as much as I 
do.
 
  113 55
Since your arrival, Cain has spoken of 
your deeds in the Southern Kingdoms, 
defeating both Mephisto and Diablo. At 
first, I scoffed at his tales, but I'm 
finding them more believable with every 
passing day.
 
  114 73
You have inspired the people in this 
town -- not only those you rescued, but 
those you've helped in other ways as 
well.
 
  115 72
So. You brought the lost sheep home to 
the shepherd. Well done.
 
  116 43
There is a matter which I hesitate to 
share, but I believe you are the only 
one who can help me now.
 
Anya, the young alchemist and 
daughter to one of our slain Elders, 
has been missing for some time. She is 
a strong, crafty woman with a spirit 
like no other.
 
One night, just before your arrival, I 
overheard her and Nihlathak arguing 
about her father's death. The next 
morning she was gone.
 
Nihlathak has his own tale as to where 
she went and why. Don't believe him! I 
fear he is at the root of her 
disappearance.
 
Please, if you can, search for Anya and 
bring her back to us. She'll know what 
to do about Nihlathak.
 
  117 94
When you talk to Nihlathak, be careful. 
There is no telling what he will say or 
do.
 
  118 59
I would listen to Malah. Nihlathak 
speaks with a venomous tongue and 
acts as if the entire weight of this town 
rests upon his shoulders.
 
Perhaps there is more going on here 
than we know.
 
  119 57
Anya is an amazing alchemist, 
especially for her young age. As long 
as I've known her, she's never let 
anything stop her from pursuing what 
she believed in. 
 
I wouldn't doubt that Nihlathak is 
involved. Ever since her father died, 
they haven't gotten along.
 
  120 41
Anya! Who have you been talking to? 
Likely it was that meddling Malah. 
 
Well, I'll tell you what really happened. 
Anya came to me for guidance, after 
receiving a vision that her mother and 
younger brother were trapped in the 
lands beyond the Ice Caves. She had 
decided to go rescue them. 
 
I told her that her quest was a foolish 
one and that she would be safer 
staying within the city walls. However, 
she is a willful girl and would not listen 
to me. 
 
The next morning, she was gone. No 
one is more distraught than I over 
losing her. 
 
However, if you feel the need to be 
Malah's errand child, I won't try to stop 
you.
 
  121 43
Anya's father, Aust, was our wisest 
Elder. He was killed along with the 
other Elders who erected the ward that 
protects this city. The ward has kept 
Baal's demons out of Harrogath, but at 
a costly sacrifice. 
 
Nihlathak, on the other hand, was the 
only Elder to escape the demons. 
Somehow, he alone managed to find 
sanctuary, while the others died 
around him.
 
Ever since that day, Nihlathak and Anya 
have been at odds.
 
  122 52
If it were anyone else, I would assume 
her dead. However, Anya is not so 
easily beaten. I know she must be alive.
 
  123 60
Nihlathak's story does sound 
reasonable, considering what I've 
heard about Anya. However, the best 
lies are often hidden within truth.
 
  124 56
As the daughter of Elder Aust, Anya is 
the only person, besides Nihlathak, 
who has any real knowledge of Mount 
Arreat's secrets. I'd hate to see our 
fate in the hands of Nihlathak alone.
 
  125 46
Look, I've told you! She's dead! If you 
knew what was good for you, you'd 
concentrate your efforts on saving 
Harrogath -- not on lost causes like 
Anya.
 
  126 81
It seems like everyone feels Nihlathak 
played a part in Anya's disappearance.
 
Why would he do such a thing?
 
  127 56
So! That snake Nihlathak was behind 
Anya's disappearance...and he trapped 
her with a freezing curse.
 
Here. Take this potion to Anya and give 
it to her. That should release her.
 
  128 54
Goodness! Anya frozen by that fallen 
Barbarian, Nihlathak...Perhaps Malah 
can help you where I cannot.
 
  129 80
Poor Anya! I should've known Nihlathak 
was a traitor...
 
If you find him alive, kill him for me!
 
  130 70
The snake has slipped our grasp! While 
you were gone, Nihlathak disappeared.
 
I'll bet Anya knows how to track him 
down.
 
  131 50
Hero. Nihlathak did this to me!
 
If you've come to help me, my only hope 
lies with Malah.
 
Please...Tell her you've found me...
 
  132 48
Thank you so much for bringing Anya 
back to us. I have devised this spell to 
increase your resistances as a token of 
my thanks. I know it isn't much, but I 
hope you find it helpful.
 
Please go talk to Anya. She has urgent 
news concerning Nihlathak.
 
  133 62
For one so young, Anya commands 
great respect. Now that she is here, I 
will make it a point to talk to her about 
Mount Arreat.
 
You should do the same.
 
  134 67
I never liked Nihlathak, but I never 
suspected that he'd betray us! I just 
can't understand how an Elder could do 
such a thing.
 
  135 140
Your rescue of Anya was quite an 
accomplishment.
 
  136 80
Thank you, hero, for rescuing me.
 
To show my personal gratitude, I give 
you this. I had it custom-made for you 
by Larzuk.
 
  137 43
Nihlathak told me he struck a deal with 
Baal to protect Harrogath. In exchange 
for the demon's mercy, the misguided 
fool plans to give Baal the Relic of the 
Ancients, our most holy totem!
 
Doing so will allow Baal to enter Mount 
Arreat unchallenged by the Ancients. I 
tried to stop Nihlathak, but he 
imprisoned me in that icy tomb.
 
Nihlathak must be stopped before he 
dooms the whole world. As much as I 
would love to strangle the life out of 
him, I'm afraid I haven't the strength.
 
You must go to his lair through this 
portal I've opened, kill him, and then 
bring back the Relic of the Ancients.
 
Stop Nihlathak from destroying what we 
have striven for eons to protect.
 
  138 90
As noble as Nihlathak's intentions are, 
nothing can excuse his actions.
 
  139 50
Regretfully, I know very little about this 
Relic. However, if what the others say 
is true, then Baal must not gain 
possession of it.
 
Stop Nihlathak...before all is lost.
 
  140 65
My worst fear has come true. Nihlathak 
has gone mad.
 
You must stop him, before he gives the 
Relic to the Lord of Destruction!
 
  141 56
Now, rescuing Anya -- that's good. 
Talking to me while Nihlathak hands 
over the Relic to Baal -- uh...that's bad!
 
  142 60
I saw Nihlathak leave town just before 
you found Anya. He must be held 
accountable for his criminal deeds.
 
Find him and bring him back, if you can. 
Likely, he won't come willingly, and 
you'll be forced to kill him.
 
So be it.
 
  143 55
Nihlathak is a traitor! If Baal gets the 
Relic, he shall enter the mountain and 
wreak havoc there!
 
I cannot believe that Nihlathak would 
give the Relic to Baal in any kind of 
trade. He's truly insane if he believes 
that he can deal with the Lord of 
Destruction.
 
  144 58
Ohh...This is a truly horrible turn of 
events.
 
I know it seems you have always been 
one step behind, my friend. But look at 
it this way...You have evil on the run.
 
  145 160
...What's there to talk about?
 
Kill Nihlathak!
 
  146 63
Nihlathak was never the kindest man. 
But for him to betray the whole world...
 
Ahh...Where shall his soul finally rest?
 
  147 65
My advice is to go in quick and hit hard. 
Nihlathak can't be half as tough as the 
beasts you've faced out there.
 
  148 55
You have stopped Nihlathak, but he 
didn't have the Relic! He must have 
already given it to Baal. Now, Baal will 
not be tested when he reaches Arreat's 
summit.
 
...Damn Nihlathak!
 
I do thank you for trying, though. 
Please, allow me to honor your courage 
by magically inscribing your name onto 
an item of your choosing. It's the least 
I can do.
 
  149 90
Beware! Baal grows stronger with every 
passing moment.
 
  150 93
Hmmm...What does Baal plan to do 
inside Mount Arreat?
 
  151 65
So, the Relic is lost. Do not dwell on 
failures past. It is your future that 
matters more.
 
  152 57
Nihlathak was a vile demon that shall 
find his home among the tortured 
minions of Hell!
 
You battled the Darkness without fear. I 
laud your skill and courage.
 
  153 37
Every time I hear of you, warrior, your 
deeds become more legendary.
 
But take heed. You are approaching the 
very summit of Mount Arreat. I have 
never dared venture there. It is sacred 
-- our most holy place. The legends say 
it is guarded by the Ancient Ones, who 
block the path of all who are unworthy.
 
Your reputation here does not 
matter...It will be the Ancients who 
determine your worthiness.
 
Good luck.
 
  154 63
The Ancients are not our enemies. 
Remember that! They are our 
ancestors -- our gods.
 
  155 90
A test of mettle is a fitting rite of 
passage for a Barbarian hero.
 
  156 72
You wouldn't have to test yourself 
against the Ancients if it weren't for 
Nihlathak's treachery. He was a fool 
and deserves to suffer for eternity.
 
  157 75
Every night, I've prayed to the Ancients 
to bring us peace...and now you must 
fight them.
 
Huh...Who shall I pray to now, warrior?
 
  158 65
By reaching the summit, you cease 
being just a simple warrior. When you 
come back, you will be far more.
 
  159 114
I warned you!
 
The Ancients are not like the demons 
you're accustomed to fighting.
 
  160 52
We have come too far to be defeated 
now, my friend. I have seen you 
complete many difficult quests. Though 
this may be your greatest trial, it is not 
beyond your reach.
 
  161 71
Look. I must apologize.
 
I feel responsible for your current 
struggle. If I had only stopped 
Nihlathak from giving Baal the Relic, 
you would not have to fight those 
ghosts.
 
  162 70
You've walked on the burial grounds of 
our greatest ancestors. I'm not sure 
whether I should bow before you or 
revile you for committing sacrilege.
 
Tread lightly when you walk with gods.
 
  163 68
Do not doubt yourself. I believe you are 
worthy to pass through the Ancients' 
gates, but you must believe, as well.
 
  164 75
Besting the Ancients in battle is a 
mighty feat indeed. I hope this means 
you're ready to battle Baal.
 
  165 67
You have proven yourself to these 
people. They look to you as their 
warrior, their champion.
 
  166 82
You stand before me a worthy hero -- 
and on you rests the last hope of our 
people.
 
Bear it well, warrior.
 
  167 82
The Ancients have honored you, and in 
turn, so do we. I have no remaining 
doubts about you, now.
 
  168 60
I knew the Ancients would find you 
worthy of Mount Arreat's secrets. Now, 
stop Baal before he destroys all that is 
sacred.
 
  169 31
You are a worthy hero! We augment 
your skill and grant you entry to the 
interior of Mount Arreat, wherein lies 
the Worldstone.
 
Beware. You will not be alone. Baal the 
Lord of Destruction is already inside. 
 
The Archangel Tyrael has always been 
our benefactor, but even he cannot 
help us now. For Baal blocks Tyrael's 
spiritual presence from entering the 
chamber of the Worldstone. Only you, 
mortal, have the power to defeat Baal 
now.
 
Baal threatens the Worldstone -- and 
through it, the mortal realm, itself. You 
must stop him before he gains full 
control of the sacred stone. With it 
under his control, Baal could shatter 
the boundaries between this world and 
the Burning Hells, thus allowing the 
hordes of the Prime Evils to pour forth 
into the mortal realm like an 
unstoppable tide!
 
If you are weak, the world as you know 
it could be lost forever. You must NOT 
fail!
 
  170 51
Remember this. Baal once possessed Tal 
Rasha, one of the most powerful of the 
ancient Horadrim.
 
Your battles with Mephisto and Diablo 
will pale in comparison to your battle 
with Baal.
 
The Lord of Destruction aided by Tal 
Rasha's knowledge...The mountain 
itself will tremble when you clash.
 
  171 59
I may be just an armorer, but I know 
this...Baal plans to destroy the world 
with the secrets contained in that 
mountain. It doesn't take a genius to 
know he has to be stopped.
 
  172 70
You knew it would eventually come down 
to this. Kill Baal! Finish the game!
 
  173 60
Baal has blocked Tyrael from entering 
the Worldstone Chamber? This truly 
has become a battle against Hell.
 
Whether or not it was the Heavens' 
decree, this is your fight now -- your 
destiny.
 
  174 63
You have ventured to a place beyond 
legend. You rush to face an evil few 
can even imagine.
 
Be careful, my friend, and may the Light 
watch over you.
 
  175 40
I am impressed, mortal. You have 
overcome the greatest challenge this 
world has ever faced and defeated the 
last of the Prime Evils. However, we are 
too late to save the Worldstone. Baal's 
destructive touch has corrupted it 
completely.
 
Given enough time, the Worldstone's 
energies will drain away and the 
barriers between the worlds will 
shatter -- the powers of Hell will flood 
into this...Sanctuary...and eradicate 
your people and everything you've 
labored to build.
 
Therefore, I must destroy the corrupted 
Worldstone before the powers of Hell 
take root. This act will change your 
world forever -- with consequences 
even I cannot foresee. However, it is 
the only way to ensure mankind's 
survival.
 
Go now, mortal. I have opened a portal 
that will lead you to safety.
 
May the Eternal Light shine upon you 
and your descendants for what you've 
done this day. The continued survival 
of mankind is your legacy! Above all 
else, you have earned a rest from this 
endless battle.
 
  176 53
You have done the impossible, hero. 
Your defeat of the last of the three 
Prime Evils is a great victory for the 
Light. 
 
Strange that you say that the 
Worldstone must be destroyed. The 
prophecies said nothing about that.
 
Perhaps all we have fought for will be 
lost...or perhaps we'll never need fight 
again!
 
  177 40
I knew in time you would defeat Baal. 
You have done everything you set out 
to do, my friend.
 
Ever since you rescued me from 
Tristram, I have believed in you. It has 
been a supreme honor to aid you along 
the way. 
 
So...The Worldstone was corrupted by 
Baal. And now Tyrael must destroy it. 
Worry not. Through whatever lies 
ahead I have faith that the Light will 
guide us both.
 
Go, now, back to the Worldstone 
chamber, and enter the portal Tyrael 
has opened for you.
 
  178 74
The Ancients themselves will envy our 
songs about you.
 
Please, don't forget about us! Farewell, 
my friend.
 
  179 48
If Tyrael says the Worldstone must be 
destroyed, then it must. We cannot let 
Baal's corruption prevail!
 
The world will change, true -- but who is 
to say it isn't for the better?
 
  180 60
The destruction of the Worldstone does 
not bode well for our world. But I'll try 
not to worry...
 
After all, we have warriors like you 
fighting for us and for the Light.
 
Farewell!

 1895 So, it begins. 
 1896 They'll never see me coming. 
 1897 So dark... perfect. 
 1898 So, this is where evil hides. 
 1899 Whose handiwork lies buried here? 
 1900 Planting the dead... How odd. 
 1901 Such corruption in this place... 
 1902 Evil flows from here. 
 1903 Who would want to remember this place? 
 1904 I can smell why this tower was abandoned. 
 1905 Try and cage me, demons. 
 1906 Bars can't hold a force of nature. 
 1907 I don't like it down here. 
 1908 The supernatural is strong here. 
 1909 The Rogues' test is done. 
 1910 Bah! Is that all of them? 
 1911 What I kill stays dead. 
 1912 Your time is past, Blood Raven. 
 1913 How has this tree escaped corruption? 
 1914 This dead tree teems with energy. 
 1915 These stones hold an ancient power. 
 1916 Such stones are common back home. 
 1917 Tristram... The first to fall to Diablo's wrath. 
 1918 Ruins... the fate of all cities. 
 1919 Cain! Go to the Rogue camp. 
 1920 Deckard Cain, leave this place! 
 1921 A Malus! This should go to Charsi. 
 1922 Charsi will be thankful to get this Malus. 
 1923 So much treasure almost covers the stench. 
 1924 This tower has its charms... 
 1925 Death becomes you, Andariel. 
 1926 Your reign is over, Andariel. 
 1927 Why must evil hide in such wretched places? 
 1928 Face the light or lurk in darkness. 
 1929 Vengeance... for Atma. 
 1930 Return to dust, Radament. 
 1931 An eclipse... never a good omen. 
 1932 Strange... an unexpected eclipse. 
 1933 Dark magic in a darker tomb... 
 1934 Snakes... I hate snakes. 
 1935 Serpents! I expected worse. 
 1936 The sun warms the world once more. 
 1937 The Sanctuary - Horazon's obsession. 
 1938 This was not designed by nature's Architect. 
 1939 Summoner, the dark magics have corrupted you. 
 1940 This place would drive anyone mad. 
 1941 Horazon. Your decoy is dead. 
 1942 Now I can leave this twisted nightmare. 
 1943 The Horadrim have left their mark here. 
 1944 These Horadric markings are mysterious. 
 1945 I can sense Tal Rasha's presence now. 
 1946 So, Tal Rasha... This is your resting place. 
 1947 I shall track the Prime Evils to the ends of the world. 
 1948 Diablo... I will find you yet. 
 1949 Black books make for dark thoughts. 
 1950 An ancient manuscript...  This could be useful. 
 1951 One can't judge a book by its cover. 
 1952 Ormus... You have strange taste in books. 
 1953 Ormus... study the book well. 
 1954 And I thought the Forgotten Tower stank. 
 1955 This smells worse than the sewers of Lut Gohlein. 
 1956 Levers are made to be pulled. 
 1957 Finally... The drain lever. 
 1958 This is one drain I don't mind cleaning out. 
 1959 From trash to treasure... 
 1960 What a delicious blade! I should consult Ormus. 
 1961 Ormus may know something about this unusual blade. 
 1962 Hmm, a jade statue. What should I do with it? 
 1963 It looks like jade. Perhaps it's worth something. 
 1964 I dread this place of darkness. 
 1965 This temple is a nest of evil. 
 1966 The dark magic here is dispelled. 
 1967 There is hope once again. 
 1968 Mephisto... I'm coming for you. 
 1969 Hatred stirs within me. 
 1970 Mephisto, you were no match for me. 
 1971 Mephisto's hatred was a poisonous void. 
 1972 Goodbye, Izual. 
 1973 Corruption... take flight. 
 1974 I have no pity for him. Oblivion is his reward. 
 1975 Terror stalks Hell no more. 
 1976 Eternal suffering would be too brief for you, Diablo. 
 1977 Lord Diablo I have bested you. 
 1978 Let Diablo's death end the reign of the Three! 
 1979 The reign of Terror has ended. 
 1980 A hero's mistake is finally corrected. 
 1981 Thus ends the plague of Terror. 
 1982 My magic will break the siege. 
 1983 The time has come to cleanse my homeland! 
 1984 It takes more than a siege to stop me. 
 1985 Baal. I'm coming for you. 
 1986 The siege must be stopped. 
 1987 You'll pay for your atrocities, Baal. 
 1988 Baal! Nothing will stand in my way. 
 1989 Harrogath can rest easier now. 
 1990 The siege is broken. 
 1991 My, my, what a messy little demon. 
 1992 Harrogath is free of your kind, demon. 
 1993 Oops...Did I do that? 
 1994 Shenk, your command has ended. 
 1995 The catapults have been silenced. 
 1996 Follow me. 
 1997 Follow me. 
 1998 Follow me. 
 1999 Follow me. 
 2000 Follow me. 
 2001 Follow me. 
 2002 Follow me. 
 2003 Could this be a trap? 
 2004 A coward's hiding place. 
 2005 Ahh, the familiar scent of death. 
 2006 By the Light! What is this place? 
 2007 ...Nihlathak's home away from home. 
 2008 I should have known... 
 2009 Nihlathak... you can't hide from me. 
 2010 Your power was no match for mine. 
 2011 A fitting death for a traitor. 
 2012 You were a sad little man, Nihlathak. 
 2013 Nihlathak. What led you to this end? 
 2014 Conspiring with Baal... What a tragic mistake. 
 2015 You Dark Mages are all alike - obsessed with power. 
 2016 Betrayer, you've reaped your reward. 
 2017 The fabled home of the Ancients. 
 2018 The guardians of Mount Arreat await. 
 2019 The resting place of the Ancients... 
 2020 The summit - The Barbarian holy ground. 
 2021 The fabled home of the Ancients. 
 2022 I shall prove worthy. 
 2023 At last...The summit of Mount Arreat. 
 2024 The power of the Worldstone washes over me. 
 2025 The halls of the Ancients... Magnificent. 
 2026 So, this is what the Ancients guard. 
 2027 The Worldstone! Praise the Light. 
 2028 The Worldstone! 
 2029 The Worldstone. What power. 
 2030 The legendary Worldstone - guardian of the Natural realm. 
 2031 The last of the Three has fallen. 
 2032 The Prime Evils are no more. 
 2033 Baal, never doubt my skills. 
 2034 Baal, you shall no longer taint this mortal realm. 
 2035 My work here is truly done. 
 2036 The Evil brotherhood is no more. 
 2037 Baal! Join your brothers in oblivion.
